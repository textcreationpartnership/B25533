            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Ingenious Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SAINT <hi>Paul</hi> confessed, that he (and other able Ministers of the New Testament, <hi>2 Cor. 3.6.</hi>) did know but in part, <hi>1 Cor. 13.9, 10.</hi> though they were stewards of the mysteries of God, <hi>1 Cor. 4.1.</hi> And <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> yea, <hi>Austin,</hi> and also the ancient Fathers did profess, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the Revelation of the Prophecies written by <hi>John</hi> in this Book: And although I have read this part of the holy Scripture of Truth many times over, and have also read the profitable labours of those learned Men who have written thereon: <hi>Yet I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Prophetical part of this Book is so mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I know very little of the mystery of the prophecies thereof.</hi> Notwithstanding, I will give the Readers two reasons why I here present this Exposition of
<pb facs="tcp:204666:3"/>the whole book of the Revelation, to be read by them. <hi>First,</hi> Those learned and godly Men have improved their five Talents of knowledge and wisdom, in their studies and labours published for the benefit of others, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, expounding, and writing their understanding of the <hi>Revelations of Jesus Christ to his servant</hi> John (written in this Book:) And I dare not hide my Talent, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that my Lord and Master will <hi>shortly</hi> call me to give an account of my Stewardship. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That promised blessing, <hi>Rev. 1. Vers. 3.</hi> did incourage me to read, study, and expound this part of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, publickly in the course of my Ministry: And now (being aged) I have adventured to publish this my <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> thereof <hi>(such as it is)</hi> for the benefit of them that shall read it, that they also may be partakers of <hi>that blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I do humbly counsel the <hi>Reader</hi> to consider, that the words of the Prophecy of this Book, do bear an <hi>allusion</hi> unto other <hi>sacred</hi> Prophecies in the <hi>holy</hi> Scripture, wherein <hi>several</hi> things are spoken after the <hi>manner</hi> of the holy Prophets and <hi>Customs</hi> of the Jews. The <hi>Historical</hi> matter of this Book concerns the state of the Church of God, from the days of the Apostle <hi>John</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Patmos</hi> (about the year <hi>96.</hi>) in the Reign of <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperor unto the end of this World. And therefore, I would advise the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> diligently to observe what is already past and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, what is now fulfilling in our days, and what is hereafter to be fulfilled. And to that end search the
<pb facs="tcp:204666:3"/>Scriptures, read Ecclesiastical Histories, and other <hi>Expositions</hi> of this Book, together with this <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That thereby, when you read the Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> you may understand the Mysteries, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and the Visions therein contained, <hi>especially</hi> the Vision of the <hi>Seven Seals,</hi> which contain the judgments of God, that he executed upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Pagan Idolaters, <hi>Rev. 6.4-17.</hi> and of the <hi>Seven Trumpets,</hi> which contain the Woes God executed upon the <hi>Arian</hi> Apostate Persecutors, <hi>Rev. 8.7-13.</hi> and <hi>9.1.</hi> to <hi>21.</hi> and of the <hi>Seven Vials of the last Plagues</hi> of God Almighty, which he will cause his Angels to pour out upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichristian Papal Beast, Whore, and false Prophet, to their utter destruction, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>18.8-10-19-21.</hi> and <hi>19.19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Consider the glorious appearance of our blessed LORD Jesus Christ at his <hi>Second</hi> coming, <hi>Rev. 20, 21, 22. Chapters</hi> of this Prophecy of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the glorious state of the Kingdom of Christ, and of the Church of God on Earth, <hi>Rev. 5.9, 10.</hi> and <hi>21.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> and <hi>22.7-12-20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> I have <hi>purposely</hi> omitted to Write or Print the Words of many Scriptures in this my <hi>Exposition,</hi> because I was not willing to make the Book, nor price of it great, the worth whereof being <hi>(in my own opinion)</hi> small, but yet I do intreat thee to read the words thereof in the Bible <hi>very diligently,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:204666:4"/>for they are the Scripture Proof of that which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and the ground of faith to believe it; that so thy faith <hi>may not stand in the wisdom of Men, but in the power of God, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.5.</hi> Pray often and fervently, that God will open those Scriptures unto thee, and open thy understanding, and seal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions upon thy heart. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>[And heard behind me a great Voice, as of a Trumpet.]</hi> This Vision <hi>(and all the Visions of God)</hi> consists of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heard and something seen.

               <p>It is called <hi>[a great Voice,]</hi> to wit, the Voice of the great God our Saviour Jesus Christ; <hi>as of a Trumpet,</hi> (as <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.1.) <hi>that is,</hi> a loud Voice, and thereby a certain and distinct sound and Voice of Words in a Tongue or Language, which <hi>John</hi> did well understand, as appears by the Verse following.</p>

               <p>It is the Liberty of the Ministers of Christ, when they cannot edify the Churches of God by Preaching unto them, to endeavour their Edification by Writing unto them. <hi>[What thou feest, Write in a Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[<hi>And send it unto the Seven Churches which are in Asia,</hi> &amp;c.] Those Seven Churches were planted by the Apostles in the Seven <hi>principal</hi> Cities in the <hi>Lesser Asia,</hi> here named, and hence each particular Church denominated, as appears in the Second and Third Chapters of this Book, in the exposition whereof, more will be spoken of this matter: All that I shall say in <hi>general</hi> touching these, <hi>(and other Churches of God mentioned in the holy Scripture)</hi> in this place is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That each Church contained and comprehended, the whole number of them that believed in Jesus Christ, confessed the Faith of the Gospel, and walked in the Order and Ordinances of the Lord in one City and Suburbs thereof; and had the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that City, and was called the Church of God in that City. Search these Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. and 11.22. also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and 14.34. likewise, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1, 5. and 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1, 8, 12, 18. and Chap. 3.1, 7, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although the Church in any City, at the beginning and first Planting of it, was but <hi>one</hi> Congregation, and assembled themselves together in one place, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. and 4.31. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. yet when the number of the Disciples was multiplied, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. and 6.1, 2. and Multitudes both Men and Women were added to the Lord, and by the Lord to the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 47. and 4.4. and 5.14. then the Church was necessitated, for the Edification of the Multitude, and great number of the Members thereof, to assemble themselves together in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations, and became distinct Companies, of whom
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204666:8"/>we read <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19, 23. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had their own Company or Congregation, and so had <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> and each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Congregation had their Elders and Deacons, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. and the denomination of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. and are called Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.16. The Apostles Writing to the Saints in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> said, <hi>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.34. and 2 Cor. 8.24. <hi>Shew ye to them, and before the Churches, the proof of your Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Church is an <hi>Homogenial</hi> Word, <hi>As Water in the Sea,</hi> in a River, in a Well, and in a Spoon, <hi>is called Water;</hi> so the Assembly or Congregation of Sanctified Believers in the <hi>general</hi> Assembly, is called the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. and the <hi>particular</hi> Assemblies or Congregations in any City is called the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1, 2. so in any Village or Town, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1. yea, in any House, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And I turned to see the Voice that spake with me: And being turned, I saw Seven Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks;</p>
               <p>To <hi>[see the Voice]</hi> of God, is <hi>figuratively</hi> and <hi>prophetically</hi> put for hearing, understanding, and receiving that Truth or Word of God, which by the <hi>[Voice]</hi> was spoken to him, as, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>The Word that Isaiah the Son of Amos saw;</hi> that is, the Prophecy that <hi>Isaiah</hi> heard, understood and received by the Word of the Lord. <hi>[That spake with me.]</hi> God did [<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And being turned, I saw Seven Golden Candlesticks.]</hi> Here begins the <hi>Second</hi> part of this <hi>First</hi> Vision, <hi>to wit,</hi> that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saw: Those <hi>[Seven Candlesticks]</hi> are Interpreted by Christ himself, <hi>Vers.</hi> 20. to be the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> unto whom <hi>John</hi> was commanded to send this Book, <hi>Verse</hi> 11.

Such a discovery of Christ <hi>Stephen</hi> had, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.55, 56. His was <hi>Real,</hi> this <hi>Mystical,</hi> as appears by the Metaphorical Description of Christ here following.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Cloathed with a Garment down to the Foot,</hi> &amp;c.] Long Garments were worn among the <hi>Jews</hi> by two sorts of Persons, and both for distinction from others, and for dignity above others; <hi>namely,</hi> Kings and Priests, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.6-9. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.20-23.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>[The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the Seven Golden Candlesticks.]</hi> A Mystery implies, <hi>First,</hi> Some secret or hidden thing, not obvious unto every Eye, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. until it be revealed and made known. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some real and excellent thing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. worth our knowledge and understanding, being profitable to us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some practicable thing, and applicable for our use and behalf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27. when we know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The Seven Stars are the Angels of the Seven Churches.]</hi> Why the Ministers of the Gospel are called <hi>[Stars]</hi> see <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. The Ministry of the Law was cloudy and dark, in comparison of the Ministery of the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6-11. This excelled it in Glory, therefore the Ministers of the Gospel are called <hi>[Stars,]</hi> and they are also called Angels, because they are the <hi>special</hi> Messengers of God, whom HE sendeth to Preach the glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Salvation by Jesus Christ unto the People, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.52. And the Churches received the Ministers of Christ as Angels, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>Christ puts this Name of Dignity upon his Ministers, that the Churches and People to whom they Preach, should count them worthy of double Honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. therefore called [<hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi>] worthy to be honoured for their shining Light and diligent Labour: The Churches and Saints should have such Ministers in <hi>Reputation,</hi> and esteem them <hi>highly</hi> in love for their Works sake; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.29. and 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.13. These Names of Dignity should put the Ministers of Christ in mind of their Duty, <hi>to wit,</hi> to let their Light shine before Men, <hi>for they are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204666:12"/>called Stars,</hi> Matth. 5.16. and to wait on their Ministry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8-11. <hi>not slothful in business, but fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord,</hi> for they are called Angels, (<hi>who are Gods Ministers and his Ministering Spirits,</hi> Heb. 1.7-14.) such ought Christs Ministers to be, his and his Churches Ministring Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And the seven Candlesticks which thou sawest, are the seven Churches.]</hi> The <hi>Candlestick</hi> in Gods Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.31-37-40. was of pure Gold, <hi>with Seven Lamps lighted, according to the pattern which God shewed Moses in the Mount.</hi> The Church of God under the first and old Covenant, and Mosaical Dispensation of the Law, being National and but one Church, Tabernacle and Temple was Represented by a Golden Candlestick, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.2. The Church of God under the second and new Covenant and Apostolical Dispensation of the Gospel, being Congregational, were represented unto <hi>John</hi> by <hi>two Candlesticks,</hi> Rev. 11.4. <hi>and here by seven,</hi> Vers. 12.20.</p>
               <p>The Churches of Saints under the Gospel and new Covenant of Grace, are fitly resembled unto <hi>Candlesticks,</hi> because the shining and glorious Light, <hi>First,</hi> Of the knowledge of Salvation to Sinners; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the pure and spiritual Worship of God by his Saints; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of the manifold wisdom of God and his Glory, is to be made known by the Churches throughout all Ages, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11-21. and therefore the Church of God, under the Dispensation of the Gospel, is called <hi>the Pillar of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. for the Truth, as it is in Jesus, is born forth and declared thereby. As the <hi>Edicts,</hi> and Laws, and Proclamations of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, Kings and Princes of this World, are fixed upon Pillars to be known and read of all Men; so Gods Truth, Christ's Laws, and all his holy Ordinances, are given unto his Churches, and are to be declared and administred in his Churches <hi>visibly</hi> and <hi>publickly,</hi> to the Glory and Praise of God.</p>

               <p>The Churches of Saints have Power and Authority from Christ to try the Calling, Gifts, Doctrine, and Conversation of their Teachers, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. and <hi>Act.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4-12-18.</p>

               <p>[<hi>But I have a few things against thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Those few things were not Sins of infirmity, for God useth to pass by the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of his Churches, Ministers and Saints of that kind, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. but Sins of Enormity, gross Pollutions, and defiling Abominations, which Christ saw amongst them in this Church, that were held fast by some of her Teachers and Members, which his Soul loathed, as appears by those iniquities Christ charged them with, in the 14th. and 15th. <hi>Verses.</hi>

               <p>[<hi>Because thou hast there them that hold the Doctrine of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> &amp;c.] You may read [<hi>the Doctrine of Balaam,</hi> Num. 31.16.] <hi>to wit,</hi> the wicked counsel he gave to the <hi>Midianitish</hi> Women, which occasioned the People of Israel to commit Whoredom with the Daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> and to commit Idolatry also, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Numb. 25.1, 2, 3. for which wicked counsel <hi>Balaam</hi> was killed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.8.

               <p>Some Teachers in this Church, by their false Doctrines and Opinions, did <hi>(like Balaam) [cast a stumbling block]</hi> before the Members of this Church, which became a sin and a snare unto them, as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Doctrine and Counsel did unto the people of Israel.</p>

               <p>It is a sinful fault in any Church to suffer those Ministers or Members to continue in their Society, and to have Communion with them who teach such Doctrines, or practice such deeds as Christ hateth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2-5-7-13. <hi>See the Exposition of the</hi> 20th.

               <p>[<hi>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Christ in this <hi>Verse,</hi> and the three following <hi>Verses,</hi> doth reprove this Church and her Ministers for suffering corrupt and false Doctrine to be Preached amongst them, whereby his Servants were <hi>seduced, that is,</hi> drawn away from the Truth, and led into Errors both of Judgment and in Conversation.

                  <hi>[Because thou sufferest that Woman Jezabel, which calleth her self a Prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants.]</hi> Not that there was such a <hi>Woman</hi> in the Church called <hi>Jezabel,</hi> or any other <hi>Woman</hi> that pretended to be a <hi>Prophetess,</hi> who taught or spake <hi>publickly</hi> in the Church, for that was against the Law of Christ

               <p n="21">21. And I gave her space to repent of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and she repented not.</p>
               <p>Here followeth the manifestation of Christs patience; [<hi>I gave her space to repent of her fornication,</hi> that is, Christ did forbear to punish her for a time, expecting that she should repent both of her corrupt Doctrine, and also of her wicked life. <hi>[And she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not]</hi> notwithstanding all his patience and long suffering, she remained impenitent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.21. and 16.9.</p>

                  <hi>[Behold,] that is,</hi> consider what I say, and how I threaten this false <hi>Prophetess,</hi> or wicked <hi>Woman,</hi> and lay it to heart; she is past recovery, having lived <hi>impenitently</hi> in her Whoredoms, both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and spiritual fornications; but yet those that have been seduced and inticed by her Doctrine to commit fornication, shall have some longer time of repentance.

               <p>[<hi>And I will kill her Children with death,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>[Her Children]</hi> were the Children of <hi>Whoredoms,</hi> begotten by her corrupt <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and in that sence, born of <hi>fornications;</hi> not that there was such a Woman in this <hi>Church,</hi> nor that these <hi>[her Children]</hi> were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by corporal fornication: But as the <hi>Mother</hi> is a <hi>Mystical</hi> Woman, so <hi>[her Children]</hi> are those that she seduced by her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to commit fornication. And by <hi>Children</hi> here, we are to understand some Members of this Church, who being seduced by <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s Doctrine, did commit fornication, <hi>that is,</hi> both spiritual and corporal Whoredom, which is called by Christ <hi>[their deeds.]</hi> As the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> had their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and their <hi>deeds,</hi> so <hi>Jezabel</hi> had her <hi>Doctrine</hi> and her <hi>deeds.</hi> By <hi>[killing her Children with death]</hi> is meant, that they shall be destroyed by Gods just and righteous judgments, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Therefore deliver up her Children to the Famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword.</hi>

               <p>[<hi>And all the Churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts,</hi> &amp;c.] This is another Testimony of Christs omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciency.

               <p>[<hi>And I will give unto every one of you</hi> (Ministers and Members) <hi>According to your works.</hi>] Those works of faith, love, patience charity and service, which Christ commends, shall be rewarded; Christ will own them and crown them with acceptence, and with reward of Grace and Glory, saying, <hi>Well done good and faithful
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204666:23"/>Servant, enter into the joy of thy Master.</hi> And those <hi>Works</hi> or <hi>Deeds</hi> of fornication and other evil doings, which Christ reproved and gave them space and time to repent of, <hi>and they</hi> repented not, Christ will also reward by executing his righteous judgments upon them, even unto death and eternal condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, 6-11. except they repent.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira, As many as have not this Doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put upon you none other burden.</p>

                  <hi>[But unto you,] that is,</hi> Ministers, <hi>[and to the rest,] to wit,</hi> the Members of the Church <hi>[in Thyatira, As many as have not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,]</hi> to wit, of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> that is to say, as many of you Ministers as have not taught it, and as many of you Members as have not received that Doctrine, and which have not known, <hi>that is,</hi> have not owned, nor approved <hi>[the depths of Satan, as they speak.

               <p>That Doctrine of Faith, that command of Holy Life; which ye have already received from Christ and his Apostles, was the yoke and burden of Christ which he would lay upon them; <hi>And the yoke of Christ is easy, and his burden is light,</hi> Matth. 11.28, 29, 30. and Christ will put no other burden upon them, only chargeth them to hold fast that Doctrine and Commandment which they had received, till he come.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AND unto the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write, These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven Stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a Name, that thou livest, and art dead.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And unto the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Sardis</hi> was a City in <hi>Lydia,</hi> where King <hi>Croesus</hi> sometime had his Court and Residence, in which City the Gospel also was Preached, and had good success, for there was this Church planted, among whom the holy Ordinances were Administred; neither were any such errors in Doctrine, nor evil deeds in Conversation, charged by Christ upon the Ministers of this Church, or Members thereof, as was found in <hi>Ephesus, Pergamos,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira.</hi> This Church had some renown, and name of praise among the Churches of God, yet all was not well, some among them were dead, and others ready to die. The Titles which Christ takes here unto himself in the Inscription of this Epistle, are Two. <hi>First, [He that hath the seven Spirits of God.]</hi> See the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And <hi>[the seven Stars.]</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16, and 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[I know thy works, that thou hast a Name, that thou livest and art dead.]</hi> By a <hi>[Name]</hi> to live, is meant, the great and honourable esteem which other Churches of Saints and Ministers of Christ had of this Church, her Ministers and Members. For, <hi>First,</hi> The appearance of the Graces and Gifts of the Spirit of God, which did shine forth and were perspicuous in some of the Ministers and Members of this Church, made her <hi>Renowned</hi> among other Churches, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the soundness of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> purity of Gospel-<hi>Administrations</hi> in the Worship of God, and the strictness of <hi>Discipline</hi> in this Church, did give her a Name and a Praise among other Churches; as <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>[And art dead.]</hi> Whatsoever were the <hi>Apprehensions</hi> which other Churches had of this, or whatever her own Ministers and Members did esteem of her state and condition, yet our Lord Jesus <hi>(who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204666:25"/>best knew the present state of this Church)</hi> testified, That there was not that reality and sincerity found in some of her Ministers or Members that ought to be in the Church of God; for some of her Ministers or Members were dead in Trespasses and Sins, as, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1-5. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. others were <hi>ready</hi> to die; withering, decaying, backsliding, and much deadness, was seen by Christ among them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</p>
               <p>Here followeth the directions that Christ gives this Church, in order to their Recovery out of that dead state and decaying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they were in, which directions are of two sorts; the first respecteth their present Duty, and their future behaviour or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for the time to come. <hi>[Be watchful,]</hi> which doth more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concern the Ministers of the Church who are her Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17. and 33.2-6, 7. and watch for their Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. which doth imply, that they were not so diligent in this Duty as they ought to be; for there were some poor and precious Souls under their charge in this Church, who were neglected, and not so looked after, nor watched over, as they ought to be. The <hi>Second</hi> direction respecteth what was past, and teacheth them what to do in regard of that. <hi>[And strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.]</hi> By <hi>[the things that remain]</hi> is meant, <hi>First,</hi> Some remainders of the work of Gods holy Spirit and Word in the Hearts of some Members of this Church, which the Ministers did not endeavour to nourish, cherish and establish, as they should have done; and so partly through the security of those weak Members, and partly through the negligence and carelessness of their Ministers not visiting them, and not enquiring into their backsliding condition, they were <hi>ready</hi> to die: Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some work, or beginning of Grace in some poor Souls, which was the fruits of the Ministry; and these poor Souls, not being fed with the sincere Milk of the Word, and nourished up with good and sound Doctrine, began to decay and cool, and were ready to die; <hi>that is,</hi> to cast away their considence, to give over their hopes, and comforts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204666:26"/>and so began to decay in their gifts, to cool in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to neglect holy Duties, in which respect they are said to be <hi>[ready to die.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The things which remain,] to wit,</hi> the Spiritual Gifts that remained, the saving Grace that remained, the heavenly comforts that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the holy Duties that remained, the lively Affections that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and the gracious desires, heart-pantings, Soul-longings, and sincere hungerings, thirstings, sighings, groanings, mournings, and seekings after Christ, which remained, <hi>(though ready to die and to be extinguished)</hi> ought to be strengthened, <hi>First,</hi> By Spiritual counsel, <hi>Isa.</hi> 35.3, 4. <hi>Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, say to them that are of a sorrowful heart, be strong. Secondly,</hi> By Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food; administring a Word in season to the <hi>weary Soul,</hi> as <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.12. <hi>And I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall walk up and down in his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[For I have not found thy works perfect before God.]</hi> Here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reasons of Christs former Counsel and Direction. Christ had examined and tried the Works of this Angel and Church, and found some imperfection in them, whereupon he bears this <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> against them. There are three things necessary to make any work <hi>perfect</hi> in the sight of God. <hi>First,</hi> It must be a work of faith, <hi>to wit,</hi> such a Work as God hath commanded in his Word; and the Word of God must be the ground of our Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>For whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It must be a labour of love, <hi>that is,</hi> the love of Christ must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain Believers to be fruitful and laborious in every good Work, else it will not be acceptable to God, Duties done from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of love to Christ, and service done from the same Spiritual love to the Saints, are well-pleasing to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It must be done in singleness and sincerity of heart, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>And especially the Angels Work <hi>(or the work of the Ministery)</hi> must be done, <hi>First,</hi> In <hi>sincerity,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3-5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> With zeal to Gods glory: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the Souls of the people, <hi>Colos.</hi> 4.12, 13. by improving all their Ministerial Gifts, Graces and Abilities to the utmost; making full proof of their Ministery for the Conversion of Sinners unto Christ, the Edification of the Saints in Faith, Love, and good Works; and the feeding, and ruling the Church according to the

               <p n="4">4. Thou hast a few Names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</p>
               <p>This Verse contains a <hi>Word</hi> of Consolation, and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto this Angel and Church from Christ; which consists of <hi>three</hi> parts. <hi>First,</hi> A description of the Persons in this Church, whom Christ would comfort. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The promise that he makes concerning them: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The reason Christ gives why he makes this gracious promise.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Person</hi> were some eminent and <hi>noted Men</hi> among the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Members of that Church; therefore <hi>[Names]</hi> are here put for <hi>Persons,</hi> or men of Name, <hi>to wit,</hi> some in this Church, who were more excellent for Grace and Holiness than the rest in <hi>Sardis,</hi> some that did out-shine others in this Church; <hi>such as</hi> Noah, Lot <hi>and</hi> Job, <hi>in their Generations,</hi> or such as <hi>Judas</hi> surnamed <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who were <hi>chief Men among the Brethren,</hi> Act. 15.22. and so the word <hi>Names</hi> is put for <hi>Persons</hi> or Men of Name: Among the Disciples of Christ, there were above Five Hundred Brethren met together at <hi>once, that is,</hi> at one time, and in one place, unto whom Jesus Christ did appear after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6, 7. where, of them Hundred and Twenty, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. were <hi>the number of Names,</hi> or number of the Men of <hi>Name:</hi> So those Persons here in this Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> though very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent above others, yet they were but few. <hi>[A few Names,]</hi> that is a small number; but how few soever they were, Christ took <hi>special</hi> notice of them, for the incouragement of this Angel and Church, as well as for their particular commendation. <hi>[Thou hast a few Names even in Sardis.]</hi> And for a Minister to have but a few Members in the Church, who are <hi>eminent</hi> for Grace and Holiness, is more commendable, and more comfortable, than to have <hi>many</hi> that have a Name to live, and are yet dead; and a few that are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204666:27"/>indeed alive, but their Works, Duties and Gifts, withering, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, and <hi>ready</hi> to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Which have not defiled their garments.]</hi> By <hi>[Garments]</hi> we may not understand their outward profession, and form of godliness only, <hi>(no, nor chiefly,)</hi> for in that respect, there were some formal professors in this Church, who seemed as Religious, and were eminent for Gifts and Parts; for they had a <hi>Name</hi> to live, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some of them might be hypocrites, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.14. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the power of Godliness, and so defiled the <hi>Garments</hi> of their profession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by <hi>[Garments]</hi> here is meant their <hi>white Robes,</hi> even that inward purity of heart, and that Spiritual power of Godliness in their life, which is called the Brides Array of fine Linen, clean and white, which is the Righteousness of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. <hi>to wit,</hi> of Christs Righteousness, of Justification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Holiness; the Saints Garments of salvation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.10. which these <hi>[few]</hi> kept undefiled, unspotted, uncorrupted, unpolluted, <hi>that is,</hi> pure and clean by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. not only in the sight of Men, but also in the sight of God. Not that these <hi>few</hi> eminent Saints in <hi>Sardis</hi> lived without Sin in the sight of God, or that they kept their <hi>Garments</hi> of fine Linen so white and clean, that they were <hi>never defiled</hi> in any respect; but they were not polluted, corrupted, nor <hi>defiled</hi> with such enormities <hi>as others were,</hi> which were not the spots of Gods Children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. And, if at any time they contracted any filth of Sin upon their fine Linen, then they washed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And they shall walk with me in white.]</hi> Here Christ promised those Saints in <hi>Sardis</hi> Two things. <hi>First, Communion</hi> and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with himself, signified <hi>by walking with Christ,</hi> Cant. 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>He brought me into the Banquetting-house, and his Banner over me was love;</hi> compare <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. with 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3 In which walking and Communion with Christ the Saints enjoy his spiritual presence in his Word Preached, and in his holy Ordinances Administred unto them, which fills them with joy and peace through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.15. <hi>In thy presence is fullness of joy. Secondly, Conformity</hi> unto Christ; Christ was cloathed in <hi>white</hi> Rayment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.2. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8-14. and his Saints shall be cloathed also in <hi>white, Rev.</hi> 19.8-14. <hi>that is,</hi> they shall be like
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204666:28"/>Christ. <hi>What marvellous love is this—That we shall be like him?</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[For they are worthy.]</hi> Not in themselves, with respect to any merit of their own; for when we have done all we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants, because we have left something of our Duty undone; and also, because we have done our Masters will no better. The Saints can merit nothing of God, <hi>Job</hi> 9.15.21.3. and 35.7. but yet they may be accounted <hi>worthy, First,</hi> Through Gods gracious acceptance of their Persons and Services in his Son Jesus Christ; in which respect, as the Saints are said to be righteous in Christ, so they may be said to be worthy in Christ, <hi>that is,</hi> so accounted of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Through that <hi>meetness</hi> which is found in the Saints to partake of Christs favour and free-grace, to walk with him in white, Christ having granted them to be cloathed in fine Linen, clean and white, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. and they being watchful to keep their <hi>garments undefiled (as these few did,)</hi> he is well-pleased to account them <hi>worthy,</hi> that is <hi>meet [to walk with him in white.]</hi> And the <hi>Greek</hi> word here used, is Translated <hi>meet, Matth.</hi> 3.8. <hi>meet or suitable unto Repentance.</hi> And indeed, there was in some proportion a meetness in those <hi>few</hi> Saints in <hi>Sardis, even in Christs own gracious and righteous judgment,</hi> to walk with him in white who had kept their garments undefiled.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He that overcometh, the same shall be cloathed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his Name out of the book of life, but I will confess his Name before my Father, and before his Angels.</p>
               <p>[<hi>He that overcometh,</hi> &amp;c.] This is one of the promises which Christ made to him that <hi>overcometh,</hi> whether he was any one of the Ministers or Members of this Church, or of any other Church of Saints, or any particular Christian whosoever, that did or shall repent of his cooling, decaying, and backsliding condition, and be watchful, and so recover and overcome the World, Satan, and Sin; and also overcome the Beast, and get victory over his Image, his Name, his Mark, and the number of his Name, <hi>[the same shall be cloathed in white raiment,]</hi> that is,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204666:28"/>as before, He shall have Communion with Christ; and be Arrayed like the Bride in fine Linen, clean and white, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. Though they had defiled their garments with their defection and decaying, being <hi>ready</hi> to die, yet they should recover and wash their Robes, and make them white in the blood of the Lamb, and so shall walk with him in white, or <hi>[shall be cloathed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his Name out of the book of Life.]</hi> By <hi>[the book of life]</hi> is meant, <hi>First,</hi> The Decree of Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Whose Names are in the book of life,</hi> that is, in the Record or Decree of Election. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ's <hi>Record or Memorial</hi> of those that the Father hath given to him before the foundation of the World, which is called the <hi>Lambs</hi> book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Gospel and New Covenant of Grace, according to which, every one that liveth under that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, shall be judged at the last day. Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. Now Christ promising him that overcomes, that he <hi>[will not blot out his Name out of the book of life,]</hi> doth mean, that he will not put his Name out of his Memorial, but bear his <hi>Name</hi> upon his breast-plate among the Names of all the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, as a perpetual <hi>Memorial</hi> before the Father, as one of the Election of Grace, whom the Father gave unto him before the foundation of the World; and he shall be judged at the last day according to the Gospel, and New Covenant of the Grace of God, whose Name is written in the book of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[But I will confess his Name before my Father, and before his Angels.]</hi> To wit, in the day of Judgment Jesus Christ will own him that overcometh, and acknowledge him before God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and before all his holy Angels: That he is one of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Grace, whom God the Father gave unto his Son Jesus Christ, for whom Christ laid down his life; unto whom Christ hath given a <hi>Spiritual</hi> life, and hath promised him Eternal life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised before the World began;</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.25. <hi>And this is the promise which he hath promised us, even eternal life;</hi> also 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>And this is the Record,</hi> that is to say, The holy Scripture is the book of Record <hi>that God hath given us,</hi> (namely, who believe) <hi>eternal Life; and this life is in his Son, and that he hath the Son hath this life.</hi>

                  <hi>[Behold, I have set before thee an open door.]</hi> By <hi>[an open door]</hi> is meant an effectual and successful opportunity and season for the Preaching of the Gospel, and Administration of the Ordinances of God, both for the Conversion of Sinners, the Admission of Members, and the Edification of the whole Body there implanted. The Ministers of this Church had a door of utterance opened unto them to speak the mystery of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.3. and the Members and other-Hearers had a door of entrance opened to them to receive the Gospel, not as the Word of Men, but as it is indeed the Word of God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. so that the Word of God had a free course, and was glorified, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.1. in which respect, it is said, that a great door and effectual was opened unto the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9.</p>

By the word of Christs Patience, is meant the Gospel of Christ; so called, <hi>First,</hi> Because Persecutions do attend both the Preachers and Professors of the Gospel, which ought to be endured with Patience, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.11. as the Churches of Saints did, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.3, 4. and 2.13, 14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because Christ himself did pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently suffer after he had Preached the Gospel, and therefore it is <hi>fitly</hi> called [<hi>the word of</hi> his <hi>patience.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[To keep the Word,]</hi> signifies, <hi>First,</hi> to receive the Gospel or Word of God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. and 2.13, 14. though accompanied with much Affliction and Persecution. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To lay it up in our hearts by faith, and so to keep it as in a Treasure, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.11. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.66. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To obey the Gospel, and keep the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204666:31"/>Ordinances of Christ in our practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2. And, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To hold fast the faithful Word, whatsoever Tribulations and Persecutions we endure for the Name and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13-25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation.]</hi> That is, from the evil of that hour, and of those temptations. By <hi>[Temptation]</hi> here we may understand any kind of trial; <hi>viz.</hi> of Affliction, of Persecution, of Tribulation, and of <hi>Temptation,</hi> which the Churches, the Ministers and Saints should suffer in those days, (<hi>especially that hour,</hi> Matth. 24.21-29, 30.) that were to come shortly after <hi>John</hi>'s writing of this book, <hi>James</hi> 1.2. And by <hi>[the hour of temptation]</hi> is meant an <hi>indefinite</hi> time; and also a certain time, though <hi>secret</hi> and unknown to men, yet limited and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lord, when it shall come, and how long it shall last, called an hour, <hi>to signify,</hi> that it should be but a short time; our times are in thy hand, O Lord, <hi>Psa.</hi> 31.15. <hi>The time when the Churches, their Ministers and Members Tribulation shall begin; the time how long their trials and troubles shall last; and the time when their sorrows and sufferings shall end, is all in Gods hand; that is, at the Lords appointment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Which shall come upon all the World.]</hi> By the World, we are to understand here <hi>Coesar</hi>'s <hi>World, Luk.</hi> 2.1. throughout all the Kingdoms, Nations, and Countries under the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperors in every City and Village, where any of the Churches of Christ were planted; God would suffer a general Persecution to fall upon the Churches of Saints in all parts of the World, wheresoever they were, but especially in <hi>Asia;</hi> and that whilst this Church in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was in being: Which <hi>[hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion]</hi> came upon the Churches and Saints in the following bloody Persecutions raised against them by the Pagan Emperors, from the evil of which <hi>temptations,</hi> this Church, Ministers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were preserved and kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[To try them that dwell upon the earth.]</hi> By <hi>[earth]</hi> here is meant, the Saints and Churches of Saints that then were militant upon earth: Earth is not put here in <hi>opposition</hi> unto Heaven, nor can it be so understood in this place; for the Men of the World and inhabiters of the earth, were not the object of this hour of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, but were Instruments in the Persecutions of the Churches
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:204666:31"/>and Saints that inhabited in the earth: <hi>So then,</hi> earth <hi>being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguished to the Church Triumphant in Heaven,</hi> doth signify the <hi>Church militant</hi> here on earth, who was the <hi>object</hi> of this hour of temptation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Many shall be purified and made white and tried,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12-14-17. <hi>and</hi> 1 Thess. 2.13, 14, 15.</p>

               <p>The last thing in the matter of this Epistle, is Christs gracious Advertisement unto this Angel and Church; amplified, <hi>First,</hi> By an Assertion, <hi>[I come quickly,]</hi> see the Exposition on <hi>Chap.</hi> II. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> III. <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. but more especially on <hi>Chap.</hi> I. <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By a precept or charge, <hi>[hold that fast which thou hast;]</hi> which implies, <hi>First,</hi> That this Church, and her Ministers and Members, had received saving Grace, spiritual Gifts, and Gospel Liberties from Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they ought to hold fast the Faith which they had received, and to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ had made them free, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By a word of caution, <hi>[that no Man take thy Crown,]</hi> which contains both a promised and a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed reward of Grace and Glory; a Crown of Grace given and enjoyed; and a Crown of Glory promised, and hereafter to be received, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. and <hi>James</hi> 1.12. That Crown of Grace received, was, that which they are here charged to keep; and not to lose that Royal Dignity and Crown of Glory, which they had obtained who had kept the Word of Christ, and not denied his Name.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out; and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, <hi>which is</hi> new Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; and <hi>I will write upon him</hi> my new Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God.]</hi> There were two Pillars in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.15. One, <hi>Solomon</hi> called <hi>Jachim,</hi> that is, he shall establish; the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:204666:32"/>other he called <hi>Boas,</hi> that is, with strength, <hi>Vers.</hi> 21. The <hi>Pillars</hi> in Gods Gospel Temple, are Christs able Ministers of the New Testament, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Peter, and James and John, who seemed to be Pillars:</hi> I will make him a Pillar; <hi>that is,</hi> Christ will establish him and strengthen him, so that he shall be able to strengthen others who are weak, and help to support and establish them. Another use of Pillars, is to bear forth the Edicts and Laws of Kings, and their renowned Acts Engraven upon them; such was <hi>Absalom</hi>'s Pillar, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.18. so the Church of the living God, is called the <hi>Pillar</hi> and ground of Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>[And he shall go no more out,]</hi> that is, he shall have a Name in the house of God, and dwell there, and abide there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And I will write upon him the Name of my God.]</hi> By the Name of God, here we may understand his communicable attributes of Truth, Faithfulness, Mercy, and Holiness, which Christ writes upon those Pillars in Gods House; <hi>not with ink, but by the spirit of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3. <hi>in the fleshly Tables of their Hearts. [And the Name of the City of my God.]</hi> This City is the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1, 2. and is the Church of the First-born, written in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. [<hi>And</hi> I will write upon him <hi>my new Name,</hi>] that is, the Son of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. and he shall be my Son. So then, He that overcometh, shall be made a fellow-Citizen with the Saints, and of the Houshold of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>[And unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans, write.] Laodicea</hi> was a great and rich City in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> by the River <hi>Licus,</hi> near to <hi>Coloss;</hi> where the Gospel was Preached, and this Church
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204666:32"/>was planted in the Faith and Order of the Gospel. <hi>[These things saith the Amen.]</hi> That is, unchangeable, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and to day, and the same for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Christ is also the <hi>Amen</hi> of all the promises of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>[The faithful and true witness.]</hi> See the Exposition, <hi>Chap.</hi> I. <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. <hi>The beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> Prov. 8.22, 23-30. Christ is the <hi>First-born</hi> of every Creature, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. also the <hi>First-born</hi> amongst many Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. and therefore Christ in all things hath the preheminence, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="15">15. I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.]</hi> Christ had tried all the Works of this Church, of her Elders and Members; all their Administrations, all their Worship and Ordinances, all their Duties to God, and all their Services of love one to another; and Christ found the Elders and Members of this Church to be luke-warm, <hi>[neither cold nor hot.] [I would thou wert cold;]</hi> that is, one that makes no profession of God and Godliness, of Christ, and of the Gospel; or rather, <hi>[I would thou wert hot;]</hi> that is, had Zeal, Life, Grace, Paith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the zealous, lively, fervent Acts and Exercise thereof.</p>
               <p n="16">16. So then, because thou art luke-warm, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[So then, because thou art luke-warm,</hi> &amp;c.] To be <hi>luke-warm,</hi> is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken from <hi>boiling</hi> water that was very hot, but being taken off from the fire, cools and becomes <hi>luke-warm;</hi> or else from cold water which hath been set on the fire, and beginning to heat, is <hi>luke-warm,</hi> neither cold nor hot: Such were the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Members of this Church, who seemed to be Religious, had the form of Goldiness, but not the power of it, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1, 5. <hi>[I will spue thee out of my mouth.]</hi> Which expression implies, <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>formality</hi> and <hi>luke-warmness</hi> of this Church, her Elders and Members, was very burdensome unto Jesus Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.11.15. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Christ was heart-sick of those formalists, and their formality in the Worship of God, and he was willing to ease himself of them. <hi>Ah, I will ease me of my Adversaries,</hi> and make
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204666:33"/>them as <hi>loathsome</hi> as that which is <hi>vomited</hi> up, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.16. <hi>The Cup of the Lords right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spuing shall be on thy Glory. Thirdly,</hi> That Christ would utterly reject this Church, her Ministers and Members, for their Luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Formality, Hypocrisy, <hi>&amp;c. Zech.</hi> 11.7, 14.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Because thou sayest I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Because thou sayest I am rich, and increased with goods.]</hi> Rich in Grace, rich in Faith, and rich in good Works; so the Church El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Members ought to be, and they boasted that they were so; and they said they encreased in Goods, in spiritual Gifts, Grace, and good Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They boasted of their growth, and increase in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals; though it was otherwise with them, as Christ testified in this Verse. <hi>[And have need of nothing:]</hi> They thus gloried in appearance, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. as if they needed no Spiritual Gifts, or Grace; no Admonitions nor Reproofs from Christ, no Power from on high, no Reformation or Amendment, no Counsel or Advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.] [Wretched,]</hi> that is, in a wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>First,</hi> As being without God, and without Christ, and without Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As being miserably captivated by their corruptions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11, 12-16-18. and 7.23, 24. <hi>[And poor, and blind, and naked.]</hi> That is, some of them had not a grain of Grace, others dark in their understanding, and others naked; <hi>that is,</hi> in a shameful, filthy, and polluted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. that the shame of thy nakedness doth not appear.</p>
               <p n="18">18. I counsel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be cloathed, and <hi>that</hi> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>[I counsel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the fire.]</hi> As there was a depth of Hypocrisy and Formality in this Church, so here is a greater depth of mercy and mystery in her cure, which Jesus Christ propounded by his gracious counsel unto them; and the excellent Commodities which Christ here offers them, and counsels them to buy of him. Christ is the most wise and best Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. and we may buy all his Spiritual Commodities without Money, and without price, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3. <hi>[Buy of me,]</hi> that is, accept what I offer you, and take it <hi>freely, Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
               <p>The Spiritual Commodities, which Christ offered this Church, her Ministers and Members, are three, tryed Gold, white Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eye-salve. These are Metaphorical and <hi>Mystical</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: By <hi>[Gold tried in the fire,]</hi> we are to understand <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and all the <hi>Graces,</hi> Gifts and Fruits of the holy Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. which God the Father gives <hi>freely</hi> and abundantly to all that are poor in spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. <hi>[And white raiment,]</hi> that is, the Robe of Christs Righteousness, and the Garments of his salvation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.10. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>[And anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.]</hi> Christs <hi>[eye-salve]</hi> is the unction of the holy ONE, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20-27. <hi>that is,</hi> of the holy spirit of God; whereby, the eyes of their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are inlightned to see, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p n="19">19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore and repent.</p>
               <p>Christ rebukes and chastneth them whom he loveth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11, 12. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5-8-13 <hi>that is,</hi> HE doth <hi>reprove</hi> them by his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> them with his <hi>Rod;</hi> but it is in love to their Souls. <hi>[Be zealous therefore and repent.] First, [Repent,]</hi> that is, sorrow after a godly manner for your Sins, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. of Formality, Hypocrisy, Luke-warmness, <hi>&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> Be <hi>[zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,]</hi> that is, be fervent in Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. having a fervent zeal for the glory of God, the honour of Christ and the credit of the Gospel, and the example of others.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>[Behold, I'stand at the door, and knock.]</hi> Christ called this Church, her Elders and Members, to <hi>consider</hi> how unwilling he was to leave them, to forsake them, and cast them off, if they would take his counsel and amend. Behold, <hi>that is,</hi> observe well what I have yet further to say to you, ere I depart from you. <hi>[I stand at the door, and knock.]</hi> Christ knocks at the door of our Hearts by the powerful Operations of his holy Spirit, as 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.4, 5. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. Christ continued his presence still with this Church, notwithstanding their luke-warmness, (as he did of old, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.4-9. and <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.1-4-7, 8, 9-12. <hi>How shall I give thee up Ephraim?—How shall I make thee as Admah?</hi> how <hi>shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together;)</hi> because, <hi>First,</hi> Christ knew some of those <hi>luke-warm</hi> ones were elect ones, whom the Father had given unto him, <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 38, 39, 40. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. and <hi>John</hi> 10.16. or else Christ doth this to leave them without <hi>excuse, Rom.</hi> 1.20. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[If any man hear my voice, and open the door.]</hi> That is in the Ministry of the Word, and open the door of his heart, by a willing consent to accept his offers of Grace upon Gospel-Terms. <hi>[I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.]</hi> This is a great incouragement unto them to answer his earnest desire, and gracious Invitation to open their Hearts, and to admit him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, by promising them, <hi>First,</hi> Union with him; <hi>[I will come in to him.] Secondly,</hi> Communionwith him; <hi>[and sup with him, and he with me.]</hi> By supping together, we may understand the <hi>mutual</hi> fellowship between Christ and their Souls, in the sacred Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The end why the Church is so planted, builded, and formed, is that they may meet together in <hi>ONE</hi> to <hi>Worship</hi> God <hi>publickly</hi> in Spirit and in Truth in all his <hi>sacred</hi> Gospel Ordinances, to the Glory of God, and for the <hi>mutual</hi> Edification of that <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> body of Christ, whose head he is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>John</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2-11. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.12. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. 1 Cor. 14.12-26. <hi>let all things be done to edifying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is <hi>not</hi> lawful for <hi>any</hi> Member of a true Church to separate himself from it, nor forsake the assembling of himself with it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. Our blessed Lord Jesus did not blame, nor reprove any of the Ministers or Members of any of those Churches in <hi>Asia, (although Christ reproved the Churches and their Elders for suffering Errors in Doctrine, in Worship, and in manners, among them;)</hi> but commended them that held their Communion with the Church, and kept themselves free from those Errors, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Separation</hi> from a true Church is Schism, and Schism is a Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Division, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. and 11.18. although the Apostles did command the Saints in <hi>Corinth</hi> to separate themselves from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Gentiles,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14-17. and he <hi>himself</hi> did separate the Disciples from the unbelieving <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 19.9. yet, neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any of the Apostles, nor our Saviour, commanded any of the Saints to <hi>separate</hi> themselves from any <hi>true</hi> Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Ministers and Members of a Church may keep themselves from being <hi>partakers</hi> of other Mens Sins, and from being <hi>desiled</hi> with them, by bearing their Testimony and Witness <hi>orderly</hi> in the Church, against them that hold any unsound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or any corrupt manners, or any false Worship, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, 3. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.11. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. We ought to be followers of Christ, who bare his Witness against the unsound Doctrine, and corrupt Manners, and neglect of Discipline in some of the seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> and waited patiently for their Repentance; yet <hi>HE</hi> did not forsake them, nor reject them, but owned them to be his Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. and 2.12-14, 15, 16-18-20-22-23. and 3.14-19-22. until they added sinal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency unto their Iniquity and Transgressions.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:204666:35"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Churches of Christ, and the Ministers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof shall be broken, dispersed, scattered, and <hi>mystically</hi> slain and killed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> God will gather his Churches of Saints again; and will glorify the house of his Glory, and give them Pastors after his own heart, pure Worship and Ordinances, and they shall serve him with one consent, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9-13-17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.18.60.4. <hi>John</hi> 11.52. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> When the Churches of Saints are scattered by Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. and 9.12. then the Ministers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may assemble themselves together in several Companies, as <hi>Act.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3-18-23. <hi>John</hi> 20.19-23-26. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2, 3, 4-13, 14, 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. and they may Preach privately, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.18-27, 28-40, 41, 42. they may also break bread from House to House, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42-46. not only on the <hi>first</hi> day of the Week, for Christ did break bread on the <hi>fifth</hi> day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26-31. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25. <hi>The Apostle also did break bread</hi> on the second day Morning early, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7, 8-11. <hi>after midnight, before break of day.</hi> And the <hi>Brethren</hi> that have received a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Gift, may <hi>minister</hi> the same one to another, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4.10, 11. building up themselves in their most holy Faith, praying in the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 20, 21.

               <p>
                  <hi>[After this I looked.]</hi> That is, after the Apostle <hi>John</hi> had seen the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>seven Golden Candlesticks,</hi> he looked, <hi>that is,</hi> He waited and expected to have more <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> from the

               </p>
               <p>[<hi>And behold, a door</hi> was <hi>opened in Heaven.] Stephen</hi> had Heaven opened, and saw the Glory of God, and Jesus Christ standing on the right hand of God, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7.55, 56. <hi>Peter</hi> also <hi>saw</hi> Heaven opened, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.11-16. and St. <hi>John</hi> beheld a door opened in Heaven; <hi>that is,</hi> he had an open Vision of <hi>unseen</hi> Glory, as <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> had, and a Revelation of things that should come to pass.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And the first Voice which I heard,</hi> (see Chap. 1.10, 11.) was <hi>as it were of a Trumpet talking with me;</hi>] that is, a loud Voice, full of <hi>Majesty,</hi> yet familiar and <hi>friendly,</hi> talking with me. <hi>John</hi>'s Spiritual acquaintance with Jesus Christ in Glory, begot a holy and humble familiarity with his Majesty without fear.—</p>
               <p>

               <p>As soon as Christ had said unto <hi>John,</hi> Come up hither, he was immediately in the Spirit; <hi>that is,</hi> without any delay, <hi>instantly, [I was in the Spirit,]</hi> or in a spiritual Rapture and Ecstasie.

               <p>
                  <hi>[And he that sate upon the Throne.]</hi> To sit upon a Throne, doth signify, <hi>First,</hi> To make Laws and Constitutions for all his Subjects, his Churches, Ministers and Saints, how they should walk and Worship God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is One Law-Giver, Isa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our Law-giver—The Lord is our King, and HE will save us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Was to look upon like a Jasper.]</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ, the King, Priest, and Prophet of his Church, is here resembled by <hi>three</hi> precious Stones in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Breast-plate; the <hi>Jasper,</hi> the <hi>Sardine,</hi> and the <hi>Emerald, Exod.</hi> 28.20-39. which were also <hi>three</hi> of the foundation stones of the Holy City, the <hi>New Jerusalem, Rev.</hi> 21.11-18, 19, 20. <hi>This was the appearance of the likeness</hi> of the glory of JEHOVAH, <hi>Jesus,</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. The other <hi>Jasper</hi> is a precious stone, which shineth so bright, that no colour can darken it; hereby it figured forth the <hi>shining</hi> Glory of Jesus Christ, who is the <hi>brightness of his Fathers Glory,</hi> Heb. 1.3. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. The <hi>Sardine,</hi> or <hi>Sardius,</hi> is a <hi>precious</hi> stone of a clear <hi>carnation</hi> colour; hereby is represented the <hi>spiritual</hi> Beauty, and loveliness of Jesus Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10-16. <hi>who is white and ruddy, and altogether lovely;</hi> made so precious to sanctified Believers by his sufferings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. A Crucified <hi>Jesus</hi> is a precious <hi>Jesus, Isa.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. glorious in his red Apparel; his bloody garments of Redemption and Salvation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.10. The <hi>Emerald</hi> is a lively lovely green stone, mixt with shining Rays, and <hi>sparklings</hi> of other excellent and pleasant colours, which make that precious stone very desirable for its worth, beauty, and lustre. So is our precious Lord Jesus Christ ten thousand thousand times more worth, more glorious, and more desirable for the variety of his Spiritual Gifts and Graces.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And</hi> there was <hi>a Rain-bow round about the Throne, in sight like unto an Emerald.</hi>] And Christ is said to have a <hi>Rain-bow</hi> upon his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204666:37"/>Head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1. The <hi>Rain-bow</hi> was a token of Gods Covenant with <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9.11-16. and was applied by the Prophet for the everlasting comfort of the Church of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.5-7, 8, 9, 10. and signifies that God and Christ is ever mindful of the New-Covenant, and will perform his Word to a Thousand Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 111.5. God will not break his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Psal.</hi> 89.30-35. and Christ is the Mediatour of the New-Covenant between God and his People, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And round about the Throne <hi>were</hi> four and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty Elders sitting, cloathed in white raiment; and they had on their Heads Crowns of Gold.</p>
               <p>The <hi>[four and twenty seats]</hi> upon which <hi>John [saw four and twenty Elders sitting</hi>] round about the Throne, do signify the Ministry of Christ in his Church, who had the care and charge of the flock, to feed them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and who have the Rule over the Members of the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.—17. to govern them by the Laws of the Lord Jesus Christ.

               <p>
                  <hi>[Cloathed in white raiment, and they had on their Heads Crowns of Gold.]</hi> Hereby is signified, <hi>First,</hi> their holiness or sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called the Righteousness of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8. their Garments of Salvation, and Robe of Righteousness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.10. their Raiment is made white in the blood of Christ, wherein they washed their Robes, (as they did <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>therefore are they before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple;</hi> that is, his Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their honour or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Eldership;</hi> the Elders that Rule well are worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and <hi>Vers.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>of this Chapter;</hi> whereof Christ hath the preheminence, as in all other things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.</p>

               <p>By the <hi>[lightnings, and thunderings, and voices,]</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of the Throne, the Church of God, <hi>that is,</hi> from Christ and the Elders; we may understand the <hi>dispensations</hi> of the Gospel, that cometh not in Word only (signified by Voices) but in power, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.5. (expressed by <hi>lightnings</hi> and <hi>thunders,</hi>) such are the right and just Censures of Christ and his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. against those in the Church that are Hereticks, Schismaticks, or scandalous Sinners; and the seven Lamps of Fire are the seven Spirits of God.

They had <hi>eyes</hi> within; <hi>that is,</hi> the Pastors and Teachers are to look to themselves, and to their Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. They had eyes before; <hi>that is,</hi> they ought to look that no false Brethren creep in unawares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4, 5. And they had eyes behind; <hi>that is,</hi> they ought to <hi>look</hi> after the Members of the Church, and <hi>see</hi> that they walk <hi>orderly, Col.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. and have their conversation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Gospel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27.</p>

               <p>ONE, <hi>that is,</hi> the <hi>[first living Creature was like a Lion;]</hi> the <hi>Lion</hi> is a <hi>Kingly</hi> Beast for courage and boldness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.10. and turneth not away for any, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30. When he roareth the Beasts of the Forest do tremble, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. So the <hi>Elders</hi> that Rule well in the Churches of Saints have boldness for Christ, (as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13.) and the Church prayed God to give his Ministers boldness, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19, 31. which holy boldness the Ministers of Christ are to exercise, both in Preaching the Word, and in Ruling and Governing the Church and Flock of Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. and 3.10. according to Christs Institutions.</p>

               <p>[<hi>And the fourth living Creature</hi> was <hi>like a flying Eagle.</hi>] The <hi>Eagle</hi> flieth <hi>aloft</hi> towards Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.3. <hi>she mounteth up on high,</hi> Job 39.27. whereunto the <hi>Teachers</hi> in the Churches of Saints are fitly resembled, who give attendance to Reading, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, Interpreting and Teaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6, 7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13-15. studying to shew themselves Workmen <hi>approved</hi> of God, who need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the <hi>Word of Truth;</hi> especially the Prophecies and Mysteries of the Gospel, and of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; as <hi>Act.</hi> 28.31.</p>

               <p>Every Vision of God in his Word consists of Two general Parts: <hi>First,</hi> Something seen; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> Something heard: [<hi>And I saw in the right hand of him that sate on the Throne, a Book written,</hi> &amp;c.] The Prophets and Apostles being in a Trance had their Eyes open, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.10, 11.

This Book contained Seven Rolls of Parchment, which were every one <hi>fealed</hi> up one within another; so that when the <hi>First</hi> Roll and Seal was opened, <hi>only</hi> what was written <hi>within,</hi> and on the <hi>backside</hi> of that Roll might be read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.1, 3, 7, 9.

               <p>This strong <hi>Angel</hi> was one of the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> of God, who are his ministring Spirits <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Haply</hi> that ministring Angel, by whom Jesus Christ sent and signified these things unto his Servant <hi>John,</hi> see <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1.

               <p>It appears that St. <hi>John</hi> was very much troubled, <hi>for he wept much:</hi> The Servant of the Lord was very <hi>sensible,</hi> what a Loss it would be to him, and to the Church of God, if this sealed Book should not be unsealed, and the mysterial Prophecies therein should not be opened; therefore he wept and mourned.</p>

               <p>The Apostle is forbid to weep. <hi>[One of the Elders said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, weep not.] John</hi>'s Affectionate Sorrow might hinder him from attending unto the glad Tydings brought unto him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elder first prohibited him from weeping: Tears and Sorrows may hinder choice Christians, and indispose them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Spiritual Comforts. The Elder having shut the floodgate of the Apostles sorrow, he bids him <hi>attend</hi> diligently to what he had to say unto him. <hi>Behold,</hi> that is, <hi>diligently</hi> attend, and <hi>seriously</hi> consider what message I bring, and what glad tydings I have to declare, <hi>[The Lion of the tribe of Judah,]</hi> that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, for he came of that Tribe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14. and thence the <hi>Kingly</hi> Race did spring and succeed until Christ came in the flesh, who was born King of the <hi>Jews, Gen.</hi> 49.10.

               <p n="6">6. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the Throne, and of the four Beasts, and in the midst of the Elders stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</p>
               <p>The Apostle did not slight, nor neglect the Elders counsel, who said unto him, <hi>Behold. [And I beheld, and lo,]</hi> that is, I looked and saw <hi>[a Lamb as it had been slain,]</hi> to wit, the Crucified living Lamb of God, <hi>the Son of God.</hi> See the <hi>first</hi> Chapter and the <hi>eighteenth</hi> Verse. <hi>[In the midst of the Throne, and of the four living Creatures, and in the midst of the Elders stood a Lamb.]</hi> The Lord our Passover, who was Sacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.

               <p n="1">1. AND I saw when the Lamb opened one of the Seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four Beasts, saying, Come, and see.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus Christ having prevailed to open this Sealed Book of the Revelation, which God gave unto him, and he took it out of his right hand. Now <hi>John</hi> saw him open <hi>one</hi> of the Seals; <hi>that is,</hi> the first in order of the seven Seals of this book; it is an <hi>Hebraism,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> used so to express, and call the first of times, things or Persons, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5. [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>one day,</hi>] that is, the <hi>First</hi> day. It is also an <hi>Helenism;</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> used to express and call the <hi>first</hi> of Sabbaths, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.2. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>early upon</hi> one <hi>of the Sabbaths,</hi>] that is, upon the <hi>first</hi> Sabbath, <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. For that <hi>first</hi> Day of the Week was the first Christian Sabbath; called the Lord's Day. See the Exposition upon <hi>Chap.</hi> I. <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. So here, by <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Seals</hi> is <hi>meant</hi> the first of the seven Seals. Likewise, by <hi>one</hi> of the four living Creatures, is <hi>meant</hi> the <hi>first</hi> of them, and so the <hi>Second, Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth, Vers.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living Creatures, saying, Come, and see.]</hi> This invitation was given by the <hi>first</hi> of the four living Creatures unto <hi>John,</hi> whose voice is like the noise of thunder, as when a Lion roareth. The voice of God revealing his secret judgments by his Prophets and Ministers, is compared unto the roaring of a Lion, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>The Lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesie? [Come and see,]</hi> that is, Come hither <hi>near</hi> to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and look into this <hi>first</hi> Vision, now opened by the Lamb, our Lord Jesus Christ, as Mediator: Now those that are unlearned, even Babes in Christ, Gods little Children may see, and read, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204666:44"/>understand, so much as Christ will reveal the mysteries thereof unto them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse; and he that sate on him had a bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p>
               <p>It is usual in the Prophets to signify great and wonderful Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions and Dispensations of God, by <hi>warlike</hi> Horses, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.2, 3-6, 7. So here in this <hi>Chapter, Vers.</hi> 4, 5-8. By this <hi>white</hi> Horse we may understand the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Gospel of Peace and Grace, especially the powerful operation of the holy Spirit in the Word Preached, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. and 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.5. notwithstanding all the Opposition and Persecution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperors, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Potentates. [<hi>And he that sate</hi> upon the <hi>white Horse;</hi>] that is the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11-15. <hi>[had a bow and a Crown;]</hi> that is, he <hi>first</hi> Converted, and then Crowned his Converts, and made them a <hi>Royal</hi> Priesthood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5-9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.1-7. <hi>Thine Arrows</hi> are <hi>sharp in the hearts of the Kings enemies;</hi> (ride prosperously) <hi>therefore the people fall under thee, Vers.</hi> 5. so our Lord and King <hi>Jesus,</hi> did in the Ministry of the Gospel. Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. and 5.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.15-22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.15, 16. Thus Christ came <hi>[forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, and to conquer;]</hi> that is, As he did in the <hi>Apostles</hi> days, so he will do in all Generations, <hi>especially</hi> in the latter days: <hi>Who hath heard of such a thing; shall a Nation be born in a day,</hi> Isa. 66.8. and 60.1, 2, 3, 4-7. and <hi>Joel</hi> 2.27, 28, 29. <hi>So mightly</hi> grew the Word of God and prevailed, <hi>Act.</hi> 19, 20. and so it will to the end, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>until we all come in the Ʋnity of Faith unto a perfect man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And when he had opened the second Seal, I heard the second Beast say, Come, and see.</p>
               <p>Christ having now <hi>opened the second Seal,]</hi> he hath a <hi>second</hi> sort of Ministers by whom he invited <hi>John</hi> to <hi>[Come, and see.]</hi> This <hi>second</hi> living Creature was resembled by an Ox or a Calf; see <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. which is a laborious and suffering Creature; whereby is signified those Ministers of Christ that labour in the Word and Doctrine, and are faithful unto Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:204666:44"/>
               <p n="4">4. And there went out another horse <hi>that was</hi> red: and <hi>power</hi> was given to him that sate thereon, to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and there was given unto him a great Sword.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>red</hi> Horse we may understand the bloody sufferings of the Churches, Ministers, and Members of Christ, by the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperors, who were called the red Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. who killed many of the Saints and servants of God; but yet they overcame and conquered at last, by the blood of blessed Jesus, and by the word of their Testimony, for they loved not their Lives unto Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7-11.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And</hi> power <hi>was given to him that sate thereon, to take peace from the Earth.</hi>] This <hi>power</hi> was two-fold, <hi>First,</hi> That Dominion, Rule, and Authority, which the <hi>fourth</hi> Beast in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Vision had given unto him of God; <hi>that is,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Monarchy. Compare <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.23. in all <hi>political,</hi> civil and lawful Administrations. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Tyranny and Cruelty, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperours exercised over the Christians by their Souldiers and Magistrates, by <hi>Gods permission</hi> in matters Ecclesiastical, or Idol-Worship, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11th. <hi>Chap. Vers.</hi> 35, 36, 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mystically signified by <hi>ten days, Rev.</hi> 2.10. By the <hi>earth</hi> we may understand the Churches of God on earth, and <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> the Inhabitants of the earth: The <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperors took <hi>peace</hi> from the Churches of God on earth, by their bloody Persecutions of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians: And they took <hi>peace</hi> from the Inhabitants of the earth, by their Wars in several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Cities, and Towns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And there was given unto him a great Sword.]</hi> The <hi>Sword</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of War and Persecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.34, 35, 36. <hi>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a Sword.</hi> Where the <hi>earth</hi> is put for the Disciples of Christ, his Churches and Ministers that were on <hi>earth;</hi> and by the <hi>Sword,</hi> Christ meant the Persecutions and Tribulations that should be in this World, <hi>John</hi> 16.33.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And when he had opened the third Seal, I heard the third Beast say, Come, and see. And I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:204666:45"/>beheld, and lo, a black horse; and he that sate on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>
               <p>Here followeth another Dispensation of God in the way of his Divine Providence; and therefore in the opening of this <hi>third</hi> Seal Christ hath a <hi>third</hi> sort of his <hi>Ministers;</hi> that is, the <hi>third</hi> living Creature, <hi>who had his face like a man,</hi> Chap. 4. Vers. 7. The Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons who served Tables, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.12.3. They invited <hi>John</hi> to come and see. [<hi>And I beheld, and lo, a black horse,</hi> &amp;c.] By this <hi>[black horse,]</hi> we may understand scarcety of food, <hi>some kind of famine,</hi> as <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.2. Read <hi>Job</hi> 30.3. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.8, 9. and 5.9, 10. And with this <hi>Interpretation</hi> agrees the <hi>emblem</hi> of the pair of Balances in the hand of the <hi>Rider,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.16. <hi>And they shall eat bread by weight,</hi> &amp;c. Levit. 26.25, 26. <hi>And they shall deliver you your Bread by weight.</hi> But yet they might buy both Wheat and Barley with money, as appears in the next Verse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a peny, and three measures of barley for a peny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Vision, John [heard a Voice say;]</hi> that is, some Edict or Proclamation of Magistrates or Justices, crying, <hi>[A mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of wheat for a peny, and three measures of barley for a peny,]</hi> though bread corn was dear, yet not so scarce; but that the <hi>Roman</hi> Peny, which was the labouring Mans day Wages, for his days Work would buy him so much as would serve and satisfy him for his days food. <hi>[And see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.]</hi> So that there was <hi>plenty</hi> of <hi>oil</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> though some scarcety of <hi>wheat</hi> and <hi>barley. In the midst of judgment God remembred Mercy;</hi> the <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> was spared and preserved. When God gives scarcety of some kind of food for the poor labouring Men and Women, who have only what they can earn, and are supplied from <hi>hand to mouth,</hi> yet he <hi>usually</hi> gives plenty of other needful things for daily supply.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And when he had opened the fourth Seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say, Come, and see.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:204666:45"/>
               <p n="8">8. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse; and his name that sate on him was Death, and hell followed with him: and power was given unto them, over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the Sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> living Creature, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.7. was the <hi>Eagle-eyed</hi> Teachers in the Church of God, who did foresee <hi>another</hi> Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and said, <hi>[Come, and see.] [And I looked, and behold,]</hi> that is, <hi>John</hi> looked, and called upon others to behold, <hi>to consider,</hi> and take <hi>special</hi> notice of this <hi>fourth</hi> Dispensation of God, both in his Church, and in the World. <hi>[A pale Horse; and his name that sate on him was Death, and hell followed with him,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>[pale horse]</hi> (by a Metony my of the Effect) doth signify the <hi>several</hi> kinds of Death, which were effected by the Sword, the Famine, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, and the wild Beasts. For by what judgments of God soever Men are killed, it is <hi>named</hi> or called <hi>Death.</hi> And Deaths Companion is Hell, <hi>that is,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

The place where <hi>John</hi> saw them, was <hi>[under the Altar:]</hi> The <hi>Altar</hi> here may not be understood <hi>literally;</hi> for there was then no material Temple, that in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> being destroyed, and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship abolished; but this Altar, <hi>Metaphorically</hi> taken, doth signify the happy state, and blessed condition of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of <hi>Jesus.</hi> The <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the most holy place of the Temple, as being a Type of Christ, who is our Altar, <hi>Heb.</hi> 30.10. To be <hi>[under the Altar]</hi> is to be where Christ is, in Heaven; <hi>HE</hi> is on the Throne of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. And his faithful Martyrs, are next <hi>under</hi> Christ, round about the Throne. Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8-12. and 10.12. and 13.10. and 10.19, 20. This Altar was typed out by the Golden Altar of Incense, placed before the Ark of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.5, 6-10.</p>
               <p>[<hi>The Testimony which</hi> those Martyrs <hi>held,</hi>] was <hi>two fold; First, Negative;</hi> they would not worship Idols, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>Positive;</hi> they did worship <hi>the only true living God</hi> in Spirit and in Truth, <hi>John</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. as <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.13-16. Both <hi>Eusebius</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> in their Histories of the Church, testify, that Thousands in a day were killed for professing themselves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and that in some places of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire whole Churches full of Christians were burned together, and whole Cities were burned for refusing to Worship Idols, and whole Legions of Souldiers were destroyed for being Christians, and Worshipping God.

               <p n="10">10. And they cried with a loud voice; saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</p>
               <p>The blessed Martyrs did not cry, as being sensible of any sufferings in their Bodies; for their bodies being killed, did rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13 and cry no more for their sufferings in the

               </p>
               <p>By <hi>[the four corners of the earth,]</hi> we may understand the <hi>four</hi> great Cities of the Empire, <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> And by <hi>[the four winds,]</hi> we may understand the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines of the Gospel, in contradictinction to divers and strange Doctrines, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. False Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers cannot with-hold or hinder the <hi>Breathings</hi> of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>John</hi> 3.6, 7. and 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.4, 5. but they may hinder and with-hold the <hi>wind</hi> of <hi>sound</hi> Doctrine from blowing upon the Church <hi>militant</hi> on <hi>earth;</hi> or <hi>[on the sea;]</hi> that is the Worship of God.

               <p>These [<hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>fourty</hi> and <hi>four thousand</hi>] sealed ones, were the seed of <hi>Abraham, Israelites indeed,</hi> the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7-26-28, 29. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. <hi>that is,</hi> a <hi>certain</hi> number known unto God and Christ, put for an <hi>indefinite</hi> number, not known unto any but God the Father, Word and Holy Spirit, <hi>Vers.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of the tribe of Juda <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Of the tribe of Aser <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Of the tribe of Simeon <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. Of the tribe of Levi <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Isachar <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Of the tribe of Zebulon <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. Of the tribe of Joseph <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin <hi>were</hi> sealed twelve thousand.</p>
               <p>This <hi>mystical</hi> number of <hi>[twelve]</hi> seemeth to be taken from the twelve Apostles of the Lamb, whose Names were written in the Foundations of the <hi>holy</hi> City of God, called the <hi>new Jerusalem, Rev.</hi> 21.2-10-14. upon which foundations, (that is, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Twelve Apostles) the Gospel Church of God is builded, Jesus Christ being the <hi>chief</hi> corner stone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22 called the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem; that is,</hi> the Church of the <hi>first-born,</hi> which are written in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. So then, by those many twelve thousands, we may understand
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204666:50"/>the many thousands of Gods <hi>Spiritual Israel,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted to Christ under the <hi>Administration</hi> of the Gospel of the Grace of God, <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. <hi>A great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues.</hi> Even all Christ's redeemed ones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. The Lord having given his Gospel Churches the name of <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and his Gospel Converts the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> doth here number them by <hi>Tribes;</hi> yea, by the Tribes of <hi>Israel;</hi> which is for the honour and dignity of his Churches of Saints in the latter days. The Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> are not so reckoned any where in the <hi>holy</hi> Scripture, as they are here: Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.6-26. and 1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 2.1, 2. For neither <hi>Dan</hi> nor <hi>Ephraim</hi> are named <hi>here;</hi> that Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> fell to Idolatry, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.29, 30. and <hi>Ephraim</hi> was joined to Idols, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.17. Those two Tribes being left out by Christ, are a Testimony of the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God against Idolatry, and all false Worship. God will not have any of them Sealed with <hi>his Seal</hi> in their <hi>foreheads,</hi> that receive the <hi>mark of the Beast</hi> in their <hi>foreheads.</hi> But to be left under the Dominion of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to Worship the Beast and his Image, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>whose Names are not written in the Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Book of Life.</hi> Not only <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> are omitted, but <hi>Reuben,</hi> the <hi>first-born</hi> of blessed <hi>Jacob,</hi> is passed by; for he went up to his Fathers Bed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.22, 23. And <hi>Judah</hi> hath <hi>the preheminence;</hi> for our blessed Saviour <hi>(who in all things hath the preheminence; Col.</hi> 1.18.) came of the Tribe of <hi>Judah, Heb.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Levi</hi> is <hi>here</hi> numbred, though that <hi>Tribe</hi> was not so reckoned among the <hi>Tribes,</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> divided the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of <hi>Israel</hi>'s Inheritance: For God chose that Tribe of the Priesthood for his Inheritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8, 9. And <hi>lastly,</hi> in this numbring and sealing the servants of God, the Children of <hi>Leah</hi> are more than the Children of <hi>Rachel;</hi> also the Children of the <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids</hi> are numbred before the Children of the Married Women. Whereby, we may perceive of a Truth, God is no Respecter of Persons; He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="9">9. After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,

The first thing that followed the opening of the <hi>seventh Seal [was silence in Heaven about the space of half an hour.]</hi> By <hi>Heaven,</hi> here we are to understand the Church of God, (<hi>compared by Christ unto Heaven,</hi> Matth. 25.1. and 16-18, 19.) in contradistinction unto the World, called <hi>Earth, Vers.</hi> 13. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. And by <hi>silence</hi> in Heaven, we may understand the Cessation from Churches sufferings, sorrows, weeping, and crying, during that <hi>short</hi> time of peace, quiet, and rest, <hi>which</hi> was but half an hour; <hi>that is,</hi> half the time of the Reign of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> who Reigned about thirty years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former fifteen years the <hi>Church</hi> of God had rest from <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to serve and <hi>Worship</hi> God, under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And then began the <hi>grand Heresy</hi> of the <hi>Arians,</hi> whereby the Churches Rest, and Peace was distrubed, interrupted and troubled by <hi>Constantia, Constantine</hi>'s Sister, whom he <hi>greatly</hi> favoured; and <hi>Constantius</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> and Successor became so <hi>eager</hi> in maintaining the <hi>Arian Heresy,</hi> and the <hi>Arian Bishops,</hi> that St. <hi>Hierom (in Chronicis,)</hi> said, [<hi>Omnes poene toto Orbe Ecclesiae Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum consortio polluuntur;</hi> Almost all the Churches in the whole World are polluted by the Agreement of the <hi>Arians.] Historians</hi>

Seven is a compleat or perfect number, as of <hi>Churches, Ministers, Seals, Angels;</hi> so <hi>here</hi> of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> (and <hi>after</hi> of <hi>Vials, Rev.</hi> 15.1-6-7.) With these seven <hi>Trumpets</hi> those Messengers of God were to sound <hi>seven Alarms</hi> to the Church, and also to the World; and they having received Orders from Christ, prepared themselves to sound one after another. Read <hi>Verse</hi> Sixth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer <hi>it</hi> with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>[other Angel,]</hi> we are to understand Jesus Christ, called the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Covenant, Mal.</hi> 3.1. and the <hi>High.

               <p>Christ our Mediatour standing at the <hi>golden Altar</hi> with his <hi>golden censer</hi> in his hand, received <hi>much</hi> incense to offer up (with the Prayers of the Saints) upon the golden Altar. <hi>[The smoke of the Incense, with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels hand.]</hi> That is, the Prayers, Intercessions, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and Supplications of the Saints, had access to God, through Jesus Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. with acceptance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. for Christs sake, in whom God is well-pleased; and the Prayers of his Saints also heard, their Persons and Services are accepted in Jesus Christ his beloved Son.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the Angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the Altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</p>
               <p>After Christ had offered his <hi>Incense,</hi> with the prayers of the Saints, he filled his <hi>[censer with fire of the Altar;]</hi> that is, the wrath and indignation of God, who is a confuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. <hi>[And cast it into the earth;]</hi> that is poured down upon the Inhabitants of the Earth, as <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.12. <hi>[And there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.]</hi> Now the silence in Heaven is interrupted: <hi>[And there were voices;]</hi> that is, different <hi>opinions</hi> among the Christians; and then followed <hi>[thunderings and lightnings,]</hi> which <hi>signify</hi> the judgments of God against the Inhabitants of the Earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.6. These Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods <hi>fiery</hi> indignation, caused <hi>[an earthquake;]</hi> that is, great <hi>Divisions,</hi> and <hi>Rendings,</hi> and Troubles between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches; and also in the <hi>whole Empire,</hi> as all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians do testify.</p>

               <p>There are Two sorts of <hi>[Locusts,]</hi> one is a kind of fruit good to eat, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4. the other is a <hi>hurtful</hi> Creature, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.14, 15.

[That they should not kill them,</hi> but <hi>torment them five Months.</hi>] By killing them, we may understand destroying their <hi>natural</hi> Life, Persecuting and Tormenting them to Death. And the time of their tormenting them is also limited, <hi>[five months;]</hi> that is <hi>Prophetical</hi> Months, thirty Days to a Month; are One Hundred and Fifty Prophetical Days or Years. The <hi>Beast</hi> had power given him <hi>by the Dragon</hi> to continue <hi>forty two months,</hi> Rev. 13.2-5. which is One Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty <hi>Prophetical</hi> days, each day for a year, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. so long the holy City was trodden under foot by the Gentiles; that is, the gentilizing Papists, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2.

So do those <hi>Popish</hi> Locusts torment the Consciences of Men and Women with their <hi>damnable</hi> Doctrines, poisoning their Souls, filling them with troubles, and tormenting them with horror and fear of Purgatory, and Hell, without any Ease or Remedy. The <hi>damnable</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Priests and Jesuits, can sting and wound mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, but they cannot cure and heal a wounded Conscience. When the pains of Hell took hold of <hi>David,</hi> he got not peace, comfort and quietness, by Worshipping of Images, and Praying to Saints deceased; but by calling upon the Name of JEHOVAH, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.3, 4, 5.</p>

               <p>By their <hi>[breast-plates, as it were of iron,]</hi> we may understand their <hi>external</hi> defence for self-preservations, both of their Persons and Privileges; <hi>that is,</hi> the Popish Canons, their holy Orders, and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Laws, whereby those <hi>Locusts</hi> were protected, <hi>as</hi> from the violence of the common people, <hi>so</hi> from the power of Kings and their Laws. <hi>[And the sound of their wings</hi> was <hi>as the sound of Chariots, of many Horses running to battel.] Wings</hi> signify
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204666:59"/>their readiness to the Work of their Ministry, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. See the Exposition of <hi>Wings</hi> there.

               <p>In this <hi>Verse</hi> is contained, <hi>First, John</hi>'s preparation unto his Work appointed him by Christ. <hi>[And there was given me a reed like unto a rod.] Secondly, John</hi>'s Commission for the Work which he was commanded to do. <hi>[And the Angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that Worship therein.]</hi> The <hi>[reed like unto a rod,]</hi> wherewith the Servants of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204666:64"/>Christ, his Ministers ought to <hi>[measure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worship therein;]</hi> is the written Word of God, the holy Scriptures of Truth: So God commanded his servant Moses and the Children of <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> 25.8, 9. And let them make me a Sanctuary,—<hi>After</hi> the pattern of the Tabernacle —even so shall ye make it. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. See (saith God) that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed unto thee in the Mount. And this Revelation of measuring the Temple of God under the Administration of the Gospel in the latter days, which Jesus Christ shewed by his Angel in a Vision unto his servant <hi>John,</hi> beareth some allusion to that Vision which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had of measuring the City and Temple of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.—1-6. In the Visions of God brought he me into the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and set me upon a very high Mountain,—And there was a Man with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed—of six cubits long, by the cubit, and an hand breadth, so he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. And the Man said unto me, Son of Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; —Declare all that thou seest to the house of <hi>Israel, Ezek.</hi> 41.1-5. Afterward he brought me to the Temple, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4.—So he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits before the Temple. And he said unto me, This is the most holy place. Now as God had shewed and instructed <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 25.8, 9. 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 3.1-3, 4-17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11-13-15, 16. and the Prophets, how the Tabernacle, and the first and the second Temple should be builded, and all things to be done about his Worship and Ordinances, by his holy Word which he spake unto them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11-13-15, 16. So Jesus Christ revealed to his servant <hi>John</hi> all things that must shortly come to pass, and be done about the Temple of God, the Altar, and them that Worship, which are to be measured by the Reed of the written Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Rise, and measure the Temple of God.]</hi> By [<hi>the Temple of God,</hi> here we are to understand the house of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15. which is the Church of the living God, called <hi>[the Temple of God,]</hi> under the Administration of the Gospel, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.21, 22. which was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builded
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204666:65"/>after the Apostles days, as was prophesied <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11. of the gentile Churches under the Gospel, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.14, 15, 16, 17. God at first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of the Gentiles a people for his Name. And to this agree the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;—After this I will return, and will build again the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> which is fallen down,—And I will set it up: That the residue of Men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my Name is called, saith JEHOVAH, who doth all these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And the Altar.]</hi> By <hi>[the Altar]</hi> here is meant the whole Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and all his holy Ordinances instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles, which ought to be measured also by the same reed of the written word of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2-23. I praise you Brethren,—that ye keep the Ordinances of God, as I delivered them to you. The golden Altar was a type of Christ, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.26, 27. compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. And he put the golden Altar in the Tent of the Congregation before the vail; and he burnt Incense thereon as the Lord commanded <hi>Moses.</hi> And another Angel came and stood at the Altar, having a golden censer, and there was given unto him much Incense, that he should offer it with the Prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.19. This Altar sanctifieth the Gift. The Altar of burnt-offerings, and daily Sacrifices, which stood in the open Court of the Tabernacle of the Temple, called the brazen Altar, typed forth the Worship and Ordinances of God under the Gospel, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.6. and 43.4. Then will I go to the Altar of God; that is, I will Worship God, and offer to him the sacrifice of Praise; I will praise Thee, O God, my God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And them that Worship therein.]</hi> The Worshippers of God in his Churches of Saints, ought to be measured by the reed of Gods written Word, as well as the Temple and the Altar of God; that thereby it may appear, they are the true Worshippers of God in his house, and worship him in Spirit and Truth, <hi>John</hi> 24.23, 24. For the Father seeketh such to Worship him.</p>
               <p>The Ministers of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> (who are builders, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11-16. of Gods Gospel Temple) ought to measure the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11. of the Churches, Worship, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204666:65"/>of God in the days of Christ and his Apostles, and to see that the Churches, Worship, and Worshippers of God, now in these latter days, be in all things, as they were then, and to reform those things that are amiss, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34.14.40. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. The rest will I set in order when I come. Let all things be done decently and in Order. Joying and beholding your Order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. All things in the Church and Worship of God ought to be done according to the Rule of the written Word of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. Let us walk by the same Rule. There is but one Rule for all the Churches, Worship, and Worshippers of God to be framed, measured, and ordered by: And the Ministers of Christ, now ought to measure, frame, and order all things in the Churches and Worship of God by the same Rule, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19-22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Ministers of Christ ought to take care, and inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church of God, and see (for they are called Seers, and Overseers, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.) that the Church be builded upon the Foundation Doctrines, and Faith of the Apostles and Prophets, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22. in whom all the building, fitly framed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (and compacted) groweth to an holy Temple in the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are to take care, that the Pillars, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. in Gods house, his Gospel-Temple (which is the Church of the living God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15. the Pillar and ground of Truth,) be not only Trees of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.4. but that they also be able Ministers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, both of the letter, and also of the spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. The Bishops, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in every Church,</hi>] (called Stars and Angels of the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20.) And the Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in every Church (called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that is, the Elders) that Rule well, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. ought to be learned and holy Men, taught of God by his holy Spirit, qualified with Spiritual and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Gifts and Graces; to wit, Knowledge, Wisdom, Meekness, and a blameless Conversation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1-8. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5-7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They ought to take care, or heed, that the whole Worship of God, and all the sacred Ordinances of the Lord be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204666:66"/>Administred according to the Gospel Institutions, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Examples of Christ and his holy Apostles; and not after the rudiments of the World, nor after the commandments of Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8-19-23. <hi>John</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. and their Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They ought to inspect them that Worship, and to take care before persons be admitted unto the visible Churches of Saints, to partake of all the sacred Ordinances of God, that they be sound in the Faith, and holy in their Life, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26, 27, 28. And after they be added to the Church, the Ministers ought to oversee them, that they do not walk disorderly, to the dishonour of God, and scandal of the Church; that the Ministry be not blamed, nor the weak Brethren stumbled or offended, and the way of God reproached, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6-15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. and 10.32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13th. and 21st. <hi>Verses.</hi> And therefore, I do humbly beseech the wise Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builders, and all Christs Gospel-Ministers, to take this reed of Gods holy Word, and measure the Churches, the Worship of God, and the Worshippers of God in his Gospel-Temple; and to use their Spiritual Wisdom, and Ministerial Power, and utmost endeavours to Reform and amend what they shall see amiss, and set in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. and 14.40. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. and 4.17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 19.20, 21, 22. things that are wanting, that God may be glorified, his Churches of Saints edified, and Sinners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Court which is without the Temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and the holy City shall they tread under foot forty <hi>and</hi> two months.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Verse</hi> is contained, <hi>First, John</hi>'s Prohibition, he might not measure the outward Court of the Temple. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The reason, why he was prohibited, <hi>[for it is given unto the Gentiles.] Thirdly,</hi> A Prophecy adjoined to the reason of <hi>John</hi>'s Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; [<hi>And the holy City shall they (viz.</hi> the Gentiles) <hi>tread under foot forty</hi> and <hi>two Months.] First, John</hi>'s Prohibition; <hi>[But the Court which is without the Temple leave out, and measure it not.] Solomon</hi>'s Temple (unto which Christ here alludeth) had three
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:204666:66"/>Courts, the first whereof was called the outward Court, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 42.14-17. and 44.19.46.20. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.5, 6. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.17.42.14. where all the people worshipped, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10. The second was called the inward Court, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>And he brought me into the inner Court of the Lords house,</hi> &amp;c. where the Priests burnt Incense upon the Altar before the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.8-10. when they went into the Temple of the Lord. The third was the inmost Court, called the Holy of Holies, the most holy place or house of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.3-7-11, 12, where the High Priest went in alone once every year, not without blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He being a type of Jesus Christ. And there was a wall of separation between the Sanctuary and the prophane place, where the Publicans, Heathens, even all sorts of prophane Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were permitted to come to see, and hear. This Court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Tabernacle, Sanctuary, and Temple, was measured also, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 42.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Five Hundred Cubits long, and Five Hundred Cubits broad,</hi> to make a separation between the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary and the prophane place or Court without.</p>
               <p>By <hi>[the Court which is without the Temple,]</hi> (in this <hi>Verse,</hi>) we may understand any material Court, or external place of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for this is but an Allusion unto that Court without <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. And the Temple here, which was to be measured, being mystical, and figured forth by that of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, this Court which was without the Temple, must be understood mystically; to wit, the Papal Gentiles, of whom it is here Prophesied, That <hi>[the holy City shall they tread under foot forty</hi> and <hi>two months.]</hi> This Court must be left out, (or cast out) and must not be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, <hi>but separated from the Sanctuary or Temple, which is the Church of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The reason of <hi>John</hi>'s Prohibition followeth; <hi>viz. [for it is given unto the Gentiles.]</hi> By these <hi>Gentiles</hi> we are to understand false Christians, namely, Atheists, Papists, and all prophane and ungodly Persons; the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> also, and the unconverted <hi>Gentiles</hi> likewise; especially the <hi>Roman Gentiles,</hi> by whom the holy City <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> (that now is) the Churches of Saints (that now are) are troden under foot, as our blessed Saviour foretold his Disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24, 25, 25, 27. And <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be troden down of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, until the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be fulfilled. Therefore,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204666:67"/>the Angel said unto <hi>John, [leave</hi> it <hi>out, and measure it not.] Thirdly,</hi> The Prophecy adjoined to the reason of <hi>John</hi>'s Prohibition. And <hi>[the holy City shall they</hi> (the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentiles) <hi>tread under foot forty</hi> and <hi>two Months.]</hi> By <hi>[the holy City]</hi> here is meant <hi>Mystical Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> As the great City of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is called <hi>Mystery, Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlots,</hi> Rev. 17.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the holy City of God, his true Church, is mystically called <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that now is, and is in bondage with her Children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25. whilst the holy City is troden under foot of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> that is to say, persecuted, imprisoned, confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, banished, and killed by the Popes, Potentates, Emperors, Kings and Princes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have given their Kingdom, Power, and Strength to the Beast, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.9, 20, 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13-17. and do exercise Dominion over the Churches, and the people of God, who are the Woman in the Wilderness and her seed, who have the Commandments of God, and the Testimony of <hi>Jesus, Rev.</hi> 12.6-14-17. The time here numbred, that the holy City (the Church and Saints of God) shall be troden under foot by the Horns of the Gentiles; that is, persecuted and killed by the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.17. who have given their Kingdom, Power, and Strength, to the Beast of the seventh and eighth Head, the Pope of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> I say the time is Forty Two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Months, which computing Thirty Prophetical Days to a Month, are One Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty years; (a day for a year, and each day for a year, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6.) so long the two Witnesses of Christ Prophesy in Sackcloth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. so long the Woman shall be fed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Wilderness, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6-14-17. and so long the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless-pit, who shall kill the Witnesses, and that did rise out of the Sea, and out of the Earth, shall continue, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1-5. <hi>And power was given unto him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue forty and two Months.</hi> All these four Prophecies are contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, for they all begin and end at one and the same time: Whereof we shall say more in the Exposition of the Third <hi>Verse</hi> of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The visible Churches of Christ and his Saints, have been Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, oppressed, and killed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Gentiles, the Popes and Kings of the Earth a long time past, and shall be so
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204666:67"/>for some time yet to come, even until the end of those forty two Months. <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Histories do abundantly testify the truth hereof for several Ages past; especially <hi>Eusebius.</hi> And the Prophecies touching these Persecutions in this Book of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> do testify the Truth hereof for some time yet to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3, 13, 14.12.6-14-16.13.7. and 17.6-17. <hi>viz.</hi> Until the two Witnesses be killed, and the second <hi>Wo</hi> be past, these forty two Months ended, and the seventh <hi>Angel</hi> begin to sound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7.11.7-14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I will give <hi>power</hi> unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred <hi>and</hi> three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score days cloathed in sackcloth.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Verse</hi> we are to consider, <hi>First,</hi> Who these <hi>[Two Witnesses]</hi> are. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What <hi>power</hi> Christ gives his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What their gift of <hi>Prophecy</hi> is. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What time we are to understand by <hi>[a thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score days;]</hi> and fifthly, What is meant by their being <hi>[cloathed in sackcloth.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> These <hi>[Two Witnesses]</hi> are described Metaphorically, <hi>Verse</hi> 4. <hi>These are the Two Olive-trees, and the two Candlesticks,</hi> &amp;c. By which Description it appears, that these Two Witnesses are not two Individual Persons, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> neither by these are intended any Two Testimonies, as the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor two distinct Offices, as Magistrates and Ministers. For none of these Interpretations will agree with the Metaphorical description of these Two Witnesses, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. These Two Witnesses are the faithful Ministers of Christ, called Two Olive-branches, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.3-11, 12, 13, 14. These are the Two anointed ones, which through the two golden Pipes empty the golden Oil out of themselves; <hi>that is to say,</hi> They are the Ministers and Prophets of the Lord, who (under the Gospel) have received an unction from the holy one, Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20-27. As the Priests and Prophets did (under the Law) who were anointed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Oil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.41. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.16. and they are also the visible, true constituted Gospel Churches of Christ, called here Two Candlesticks, which are so interpreted and expounded by Christ himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And the seven Candlesticks are the seven Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:204666:68"/>
               <p>The Church of God under the Law being but one, and that a National Church, was metaphorically described by One golden Candlestick, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.2. But the Churches of God under the Gospel, being many Congregational Churches, (as the Churches in <hi>Judea, Act.</hi> 9.31. the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. and the Churches in <hi>Asia, Rev.</hi> 1.11. when they were first planted,) are resembled by Two golden Candlesticks, and by Seven golden Candlesticks. Nor is my distinguishing between the Lords Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, his Prophets, and his Churches unwarrantable, for the holy spirit of God did distinguish them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Now there were in the Church that was at Antioch certain Prophets and Teachers,</hi> Act. 15.4. <hi>They were received of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders,</hi> Act. 15.22. <hi>Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders, with the whole Church,</hi> that is, all the Brethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.23. <hi>The Apostles, and Elders, and Brethren, send greeting unto the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> &amp;c. The Ministers of Christ in the Churches of Saints, are Christs Prophetical Witnesses; who ought to bear their Testimony for Christ, and against Antichrist, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Power which Christ hath given unto his Two Witnesses, is not a Magisterial Power; for Christ hath given that kind of Power to the Kings of the Earth, and Governours under them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1-7. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. nor a Monarchical Prelatical Power, such as the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Cardinals, and Priests, have usurped, who lord it over Gods Heritage, his Churches and Clergy, contrary to the mind of our LORD Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Not as Lording it over the Clergy,]</hi> but it is a Ministerial, Prophetical, Stewardly Power; that is, the Power of the Word, (not of the Sword,) <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Behold, I have put my Words in thy Mouth; see, I have this day set thee over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant.</hi> That is to say Prophetically, by denouncing Gods Judgments against them, (which the LORD will execute, if they repent not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.) <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.13. <hi>And I will bring upon that Land all my Words, which I have pronounced against it,</hi>—which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> hath Prophesied against all the Nations, though the Ministers of the Gospel may declare the righteous Judgments of God against ungodly Men, according to his written
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204666:68"/>Word, yet they ought not to sit in Judgment, and pass Sentence of corporal Punishment upon any Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14. But yet all the Plagues and Judgments here mentioned, and intended are principally (though not only) spiritual Plagues and Judgments, such as the Lord's Prophets had power to do by the Sword of the Spirit (which is the Word of God) <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of Christ's Mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15-21. so that this Power which the LORD Jesus Christ gave his <hi>[Two Witnesses]</hi> is a Ministerial, Prophetical, Ecclesiastical Power of Faith, by the Word of God and Prayer, <hi>Acts.</hi> 6.4. which they ought to give themselves continually unto, not using the Power of the Sword at any time, in any case, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.9, 10. <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear.—He that killeth with the Sword stall be killed with the Sword,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ecclesiastical Power ordained by Christ and given to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, is not Magisterial, but Ministerial; not the Power of the Sword but of the Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>For the Word of God is living and powerful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the Gift of Prophecy here, which Jesus Christ gave unto his <hi>[Two Witnesses]</hi> (called the Two Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10.) we are to understand such Ministerial and Prophetical Gifts of the Holy Spirit, whereby they were fitted and qualified to Prophesie before many Peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, and Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.10, 11. There are diversities of spiritual Gifts, and among the rest the Gift of Prophecy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4-8, 9, 10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given to us, whether Prophecy, let us Prophesie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Analogy of Faith. This Gift of Prophecy Christ gives unto his faithful Ministers in the Churches of Saints, that they may be his Witnesses, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8.5.32. in bearing their Testimony for Christ, [against Anti-Christ,] in all the Offices of his Mediatorship; and it is therefore called the Testimony of Jesus which is the Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.12-19. that is a Mouth and Wisdom given by Jesus Christ, which no Adversaries shall be able to gain-say, or resist: And it shall turn to you for a Testimony, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The time of their prophesying is here said to be <hi>[a thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days]</hi> which Days are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204666:69"/>not to be understood literally for so many natural Days; for that is but Three Years and an half; and is intended by the Three Days and an half, expressed <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. to be the time that the Dead Bodies of the slain Witnesses shall lie un-buried, called a Time, and Times, and half a Time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21.25. But these <hi>[thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days]</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Prophetical Days; that is, a Day for a Year, and each Day for a Year, according to the Scripture Account, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. which is One thousand two hundred and threescore Years. And so is the prophetical number of Days and Time of the Woman, <hi>that is,</hi> the Church of God in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, <hi>viz.</hi> One thousand two hundred and threescore Days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6. It is not my work at present to determine the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending of this Time, and these Days, but to give the right Interpretation thereof, that the Reader may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the meaning by my Exposition. God hath timed the Persecutions, Tribulations, and Sufferings of his Churches, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and Saints, in their Generations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.10, 11.12. and 29.10-13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. They must last no longer, nor end sooner, than God's set Time.</p>
               <p>But yet I may say, that the best Ecclesiastical Historians, and the later Expositors of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> affirm, That these <hi>[thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days]</hi> began about the Year of our Lord 407, 409, 410. or before 428. <hi>(Sympson</hi>'s <hi>Hist. of the Church, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Socrat. Hist. Eccl. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Helvicus in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Taurinat. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Magdeb. Cent.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10, &amp;c.) And if these <hi>[thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days]</hi> did begin about 428, then they will end about 1688, which a short time will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest more certainly. Though these are uncertain Conjectures; yet if we shall see the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless Pit, make War against the Two prophetical Witnesses, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them, and kill them, as is prophesied, <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. then we shall certainly know the ending Time of these <hi>[thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>threescore days,] Dan,</hi> 12.4-6-8, 9-13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To be <hi>[cloathed in sackcloth]</hi> signifieth the sorrowful, mournful condition of these Two Prophets, the Witnesses of Christ, by reason of their Sufferings, Persecutions, and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204666:69"/>which they endured in the Days and Time of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying. The Prophets of old used to wear Garments of Black, especially in times of Calamity and Affliction, which were made of Hair, and called Sackcloth of Hair, as an Emblem and Symbol of great Calamity and Mourning, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.12. and 32.11.50.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.3. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.12. The faithful Ministers of Christ, who in serving of their Generation have born their Testimony for Christ against Anti-Christ in all his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Offices, as HE is Prophet, Priest and King in his Church, have suffered Persecutions, Imprisonment, Banishment, and Death many of them. As the Apostles and Disciples of Christ did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under the Roman Pagan Dragon; so the Ministers and Saints of God have suffered under the Roman-Papal-Beast, about One thousand two hundred fifty nine Years.</p>
               <p>God's faithful Witnesses must suffer Persecutions for their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against Anti-Christ, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer Persecution till the 1260. days be ended.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Olive Tree</hi> is excellent for its beautiful greenness, for its plentiful fruitfulness, and its abundant fatness, <hi>Judges</hi> 9.9. <hi>But the Olive-Tree said unto them, should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and Man,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204666:70"/>the false Doctrines, Worships, and Kingdom of Antichrist; the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Beast, the great Whore, and all the Cities of the Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19.</p>
               <p>A Candlestick all of Gold in <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s Vision, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. was a figure of the Church of God, which was then but one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible constituted Church; <hi>viz.</hi> The National Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The two golden Candlesticks in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelation,</hi> Chap. 11.4. were a representation of the true visible constituted Churches of God in the latter days of the Gospel; <hi>viz.</hi> Congregational Churches of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> such were the seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> (at their first planting) <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.12-20. So that we may upon those Scripture grounds conclude, That by the Two Witnesses Jesus Christ meant and intended his Churches of Saints, and his faithful Ministers in their Generations. The Churches of Saints ought to be like golden Candlesticks for purity, for visibility, and for holding forth the light of Truth by their Ministers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Standing before the God of the earth.] Standing before</hi> great Persons; <hi>viz.</hi> Kings, Princes, and Nobles, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.8. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.29. imports, waiting and serving them in obedience unto their Commands, being in their presence, and also in their favour. So here, to stand <hi>[before the God of the earth,]</hi> is to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister unto God, to Worship him, to obey his Commands, and to keep his Ordinances; as the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> did of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. <hi>To stand before the Lord, to minister unto him;</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.15, 16.

               <p>
                  <hi>[These have power to shut Heaven, that it rain not in the days of their Prophecy.]</hi> The Ministerial and Prophetical power of Christ's Two Witnesses, is here declared to be over Waters, (as well as fire;) both the Waters that are above the Firmament of Heaven, to shut Heaven that it rain not; and this is the power of Prayer also that <hi>Elijah</hi> had, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.1. and <hi>James</hi> 5.17. <hi>Elias</hi> was a man subject to like (infirmities or) Passions as we are; and He prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the space of Three Years and Six Months. Thus he shut Heaven in the days of his Prophecy; and thus Christ's Two Prophetical Witnesses have power to shut Heaven in the days of their Prophecy.

               <p>In this <hi>Verse</hi> and the following <hi>Verses</hi> to the end of the 14th. <hi>Verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> Christ revealed to his Servant <hi>John,</hi> 1.

That after Three Days and an half, the Two slain Witnesses shall live again; and shall ascend up to Heaven. 5. That at the same time of the Witnesses Ascension, the tenth part of the great City shall fall, and Seven thousand Names of Men shall be slain. 6. That the Remnant will be affrighted, and give Glory to God. 7. That then the second Woe will be past; and the third Woe will come quickly, <hi>Verse</hi> 14. But of these Seven Particulars in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Touching the killing of Christ's Two prophetical Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, <hi>Verse</hi> 7. we are to observe these particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Time when the Witnesses shall be killed; <hi>[when they shall have finished their testimony.]</hi> 2. Who shall kill them; <hi>[the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless Pit.]</hi> And 3. The means by which he shall kill the Witnesses; [he <hi>shall make War against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</hi>] In the Exposition of this <hi>Verse,</hi> and of those things, we are to observe, 1. What is the finishing Testimony of the Witnesses of Jesus Christ? 2. Who is the Beast that shall kill them? And, 3. What this War is whereby the Witnesses shall be overcome and killed?</p>
               <p>The finishing Testimony of Christ's Two Prophetical Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses is the Gospel of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; which must be preached in all the World, for a Witness unto all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. and then shall the End be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is their finishing Testimony. Let it be considered, That the prophetical Witnesses of Jesus Christ (namely his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers) during the Thousand two hundred and threescore Years of their Testimony, have had a Three fold Testimony to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:204666:72"/>bear for Christ against Antichrist, <hi>viz.</hi> First for the propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office of Christ against the Beast and the false Prophet; which Testimony the faithful Ministers of Christ have in the days of their prophesying in Sackcloth, born by their sound Doctrine of free Grace against the false Doctrine of Free-Will, Merit, and Condignity; also by their sound Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith in Christ, against the false Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by our own Works, or by our own Righteousness: And by their sound Doctrine of Evangelical Repentance, against the false Doctrine of Popish Penance and Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then for the Priestly Office of Christ against Antichrist, Mystical Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the Beast, the great Whore, and the false Prophet, which Testimony the faithful Ministers of Christ have born likewise in the days of their prophesying in Sackcloth, touching the true and pure Worship of God in the Administration of his holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: against the superstitious and false Worship of the Beast, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her Priests and Jesuits in their Idolatrous Worship of God by Images, Crucifixes, <hi>Ave Maria's,</hi> Masses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> especially of their Breaden-God, by their superstitious and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Inventions of Transubstantiation of the Bread and Wine into the very True and Real Body and Blood of Christ, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Priest's Consecration. Lastly, for the Kingly Office of Christ as King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. King of <hi>Zion, Psal.</hi> 149.1, 2. and King of Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7, 10. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14.15. whose Kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. and he shall reign for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. Now the faithful Ministers of Christ have born their Testimony for Christ, that he is King of Saints, and King of <hi>Zion</hi> in these Thousand two hundred and threescore prophetical Days, of their Sackcloth-condition, their finishing-Testimony, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord Jesus Christ is King of Nations, King of Kings, and all the Kingdoms of this World shall be the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44-7-13, 14. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. And he shall be the only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. This finishing Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Kingdom of Christ, is properly called the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Jesus, Rev.</hi> 19.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. which is the Spirit of Prophecy. Many of Christ's Witnesses have been slain for the Word of God, which they preached, and for the Testimony
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204666:72"/>which they held, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. and 12.17. But those Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Christ, who bear their Testimony for the Davidical Kingdom of Christ (to wit, that all the Kingdoms of this World, shall become the Kingdom of Christ) were to be slain; of which Kingdom we shall treat more fully in the Exposition of the 15th. <hi>Verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>

Even he is the Eighth, and is of the seven heads. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By his Rise, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. His Continuance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. and his <hi>Ruine, Vers.</hi> 8. and 15th. of the 17th. <hi>Chap.</hi> and shall go into Perdition: And goeth into Perdition, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.21. and shall be found no more at all. To which description of the <hi>Beast,</hi> we shall (according to that measure of wisdom and understanding which God shall give) speak more largely in our Exposition of the 17th. <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the mean time, those that will read my <hi>Apocalyptical Mysteries,</hi> published <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1669. and my <hi>Treatise of Mystical</hi> Babylon <hi>unveiled, Anno Dom.</hi> 1679. may understand more fully my opinion, who this <hi>Beast</hi> is; and that I may not leave the <hi>Reader</hi> altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied in this matter, I shall at present assert, That this <hi>Beast,</hi> (with respect of his whole complex Body) is mystical <hi>Babylon; viz.</hi> The Beast of the Eighth Head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8-11. with two Horns like a Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. That Angel of the bottomless pit, whose Name is <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> Rev. 9.11. <hi>to wit,</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Star which fell from Heaven unto the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. The great Scarlet Whore, and Mother of Harlots, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 17.1-5. <hi>to wit,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all false Churches, and the false Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13. and 19.20. <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests, those deceivers, and all false Ministers, called the Ministers of <hi>Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:204666:73"/>
               <p>The War which the Beast shall make against Christ's Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Witnesses, whereby HE shall overcome them and kill them, is an open, visible, and publick opposition, which the enemies of Christ, his Churches, Ministers, and Saints do make against them, either by open Hostility, as the Popes, and Emperors Forces did against the Protestants in <hi>Germany;</hi> or else by publick Edicts and Laws, as the Papists did against the Protestants in <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, by a violent and bloody Persecution, which hath ever been the practice of the Popes and Papists; Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the III. about the year, 1159. and the Popish Powers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> with a great and bloody Persecution: Afterwards, about 1464. the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> the <hi>Wicklevists,</hi> the <hi>Hussites,</hi> and their followers, were violently Persecuted, even to death, under the name of <hi>Lollards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And shall overcome them, and kill them.]</hi> Some Ministers and some Members of Churches will be overcome by fear, others by flatteries; the mouths of some will be stopt by Preferment; others will be silenced by Threatning, by Excommunication, and by Persecution; and so far overcome, as they will cease for a time to bear their Testimony against the Beast, so publickly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, as they did before. But that will not appease the rage and great wrath of the Beast; for he will proceed further, and will kill them that still go on boldly and constantly to bear their Testimony publickly against him, his Worship, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15, 16, 17. The killing of the two Witnesses, doth not signify a corporal death only, nor principally; for such a death doth not fully agree to their lying unburied in the Streets of the City, nor to their Resurrection, <hi>Vers.</hi> 10, 11. but it is rather a metaphorical expression, by which Jesus Christ meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, both a Civil and Ecclesiastical Death, or deprivation of Livelihood, and deprivation of Life: Some of them shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all their Civil Rights, Privileges, and Liberties; their Estates will be confiscated, proscribed, or decimated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Persons Confined, Imprisoned or Banished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in fine, all their Livings and Livelihood taken from them by the Beast, and his instruments of cruelty. And others of them shall be deprived of all their Ecclesiastical Rights, Privileges, and Liberties: Yea, their love to Christ will decay, their zeal for the glory of God
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204666:73"/>will cool, and their spiritual vigour against Antichrist, and his false Doctrines, Superstitious Worship, and Tyrannical Government, will faint, and be ready to die. The darkness and blackness of the day of the death of the Two Witnesses will be very great, for they will be deprived of that spirit of life, which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had, and manifested for Christ against the Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition that sits in the Temple of God. Some of the Witnesses (not all of them) will fall from their first love, lose their former zeal, and become luke-warm; some of them will fall in with the grand Apostasy of these latter days, and thereby be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that vigour and spirit of life which they had. And this spiritual kind of Death, is called here the killing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; for as their Resurrection shall be by the spirit of life from God entring into them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. so their Death will be by being deprived of the spirit of life, by resisting, quenching, and grieving the holy spirit.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And their dead bodies <hi>shall lie</hi> in the street of the great City, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was Crucified.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Verse,</hi> Jesus Christ shewed his servant <hi>John</hi> where these two Prophetical Witnesses shall be killed; <hi>viz. [in the street of the great City, which</hi> great City <hi>is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was Crucified.</hi>] This great City is Mystery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5. That City which then Reigned over the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.18. The <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Dominion, to wit, the whole Antichristian Kingdom of the <hi>Beast,</hi> the great Whore, and the false Prophet, called the Man of Sin, and the Antichrist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The street of the great City, is the place where the dead bodies of the two slain Witnesses lie unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for a time; which place being spoken of by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, must be understood either in relation unto the two Witnesses, or in relation unto the Beast that shall kill them, or in relation unto both. Now take either of these, or both, and it doth not, and it cannot signify the whole Kingdom of mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> because that is the City, as before proved, not the street which is after Verse 13. called the tenth part of the great City; nor are all the Witnesses of Christ <hi>[in the street of the great City]</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:204666:74"/>killed, but very many of them; for there were some of them alive, who called to these dead Witnesses, when the spirit of Life from God, was again entred into them, saying, Come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vers. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Therefore, by <hi>[the street of the great City,]</hi> we are to understand some part of it, and not the whole City; that is, some very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and famous Kingdom, where these two Witnesses have most eminently born their Testimony for Christ against the Beast, the great Whore the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the false Prophet; the Pope, the <hi>Papal</hi> Prelacy, and the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy; <hi>which is</hi> (in my opinion) <hi>this Kingdom of England.</hi> For the highest, and most eminent Testimony for Christ, his Kingdom, his Worship, and his Government, and against the Kingdom, Worship, and Government of Antichrist hath been, yet is, and will be born by Christ's faithful Ministers, and his Churches of Saints (that are his Two Witnesses) here in <hi>England,</hi> especially in <hi>London.</hi> And the description of this street and City of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> if it could be delineated, and drawn to the life, or lively pourtrayed, (as the Prophet was commanded by the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.1. to pourtray <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon a Tile,) <hi>London</hi> would seem to be so like that City where our Lord was Crucified; and <hi>England</hi> so like the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yea, and both this Nation, and this City, would so resemble <hi>Sodom,</hi> that every one, who shall view and consider the Type and Antitype, will doubtless be of my opinion, and say, certainly <hi>London</hi> is spiritually <hi>Jerusalem, [where our Lord was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,]</hi> and where his two Prophets must be killed. And is not <hi>England</hi> as like <hi>Egypt</hi> for oppression, exaction, and other cruelties against the <hi>Israel</hi> of God? and (which I cannot without abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence write,) how like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> these two near-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining Cities are for Pride, and fulness of Bread; yea, for Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Adultery, Blood-shedding, Sodomy, and other Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for which hainous wickednesses, God did burn <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and set them forth for an example, suffering the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of eternal fire, <hi>Jude Vers.</hi> 7. And God did overthrow some of the Cities of <hi>Israel,</hi> as he had overthrown <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha, Amos</hi> 4.11. Yea, and God will destroy these Cities also for their Sins, if the Rulers and Inhabitants thereof will not repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.10-20. Hear the Word of the Lord, ye
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204666:74"/>Rulers of <hi>Sodom:</hi> Give ear unto the Law of our God, ye people of <hi>Gomorrha;</hi>—But if ye refuse, and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the Sword; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. And the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Churches shall know, that God commandeth his destroying Messengers to begin at his Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.5, 6, 7. and that judgment must begin at the house of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And they of the people, and kindreds, and ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these Two Prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</p>
               <p>The Two Witnesses being killed, some pity them, others <hi>[rejoice over them,]</hi> and most of the people will <hi>[not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.]</hi> The Beast having killed the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, would have them buried, that their Names and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony might not be remembred: But they of the Peoples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would not suffer their Names to perish, nor their Testimony to be forgotten; they would <hi>[not suffer their dead bodies to be put in Graves.]</hi> Which some <hi>Expositors</hi> understand to be an Act of pity and good will, and favour towards the Two Witnesses, and their Testimony. Other <hi>Expositors</hi> interpret their not suffering of the dead Bodies of Christ's Witnesses to be put in Graves, to be an Act of enmity and cruelty in those of the peoples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that rejoiced over them after they were killed, who would not let them have a Christian burial.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>As the killing of these Two Witnesses, is the last Act of the Papal Power of the Beast; so the rejoicing over their dead bodies is the last Act of the Whores joy; and both these Acts are the last sufferings of the Ministers of Christ, and Churches of Saints.</hi> For we never read of the Beasts power, the Whores joy, nor the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204666:75"/>Saints sufferings, after these their 1260. days, or Forty Two Months be fulfilled. And these three days and an half, are the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and full period of the Witnesses 1260. days, and of the Beasts Forty Two Months. And Christ hath sworn, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6, 7. that there should be time no longer; but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the very next dispensation after this sixth Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14, 15. And the seventh Angel sounded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reason why the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, that is earthly minded Professors, (who mind earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19.) do rejoice at the killing of Christ's Two Witnesses, and are so merry, when they <hi>[see their dead bodies]</hi> lying in the street of the great City, is, <hi>because these two Prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth,</hi> Vers. 10. which happened, <hi>First,</hi> By the power of their Testimony upon some of their Consciences, which cut them to the heart, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Testimony did theirs, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51-54. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the guilt of the blood of the Martyrs and Witnesses of <hi>Jesus,</hi> which wounded their Spirits, whereby they were filled with indignation against them, as the Scribes and Pharisees were, saying, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.17-28-33. Ye intend to bring this mans blood upon us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By bearing their witness against their Murders, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, when he said to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.19, 20. Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? and against their Whoredoms and Adulteries, as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> witnessed against <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Herodias, Mark</hi> 6.17-24. and against all other their wicked Abominations.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And after three days and an half, the spirit of life from God entred into them: and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</p>
               <p>Mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of Harlots, and her Daughters are now rejoicing and making merry, in hope that the slain Witnesses shall never rise again; but their joyful days will not long continue, <hi>for after three days and an half,</hi> (which is but a very short time) the Witnesses are revived and raised again; and that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation will suddenly change their joys into fears.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:204666:75"/>
               <p>This mystical Resurrection of Christ's Two Prophetical Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, is in this Verse described by three Particulars; that is, <hi>First,</hi> By the time of their reviving and living again; <hi>[after three days and an half.] Secondly,</hi> By the means and manner thereof; <hi>[The spirit of Life from God entred into them, and they stood upon their feet.] Thirdly,</hi> By the present effect thereof; <hi>[And great fear fell upon them which saw them.] First,</hi> Touching the time of their Reviving. Read <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. By the <hi>[three days and an half,]</hi> we are to understand the last three days and an half of the 1260. Prophetical days, before expressed and expounded, even the ending time thereof. The knowledge of this ending time is, that which many godly and learned Men have studiously searched, and laboured to understand, whose labours being published, have been profitable to the Lords people, and unto me, that have read their judgments, and have received much Light and Comfort in many things; but not being fully satisfied in their Interpretations and Expositions touching these Two Witnesses and the time of their being killed, and raised again, I am willing to give my opinion also, and the grounds thereof.</p>
               <p>The 1260. days, <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. being according to the nature of this Prophecy of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Prophetical number of such days, <hi>Numbers</hi> 14.34. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.5, 6. (as hath been proved) each day for a year; that is, 1260. years: And these <hi>[three days and an half]</hi> being the ending time of the Two Witnesses Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying in sackcloth, and the last of the 1260. Prophetical days; it doth hereupon necessarily follow, and hence I conclude, <hi>First,</hi> That the ending time of the 1260. days (<hi>viz.</hi> these <hi>three days and an half</hi>) are not yet come; and the Two Witnesses are not yet slain; for their testimony for Christ against Antichrist, is not yet finished, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. nor is the tyrannical power of the Beast (which was to continue forty two Months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. and 11.2. yet ended and expired. For the Holy City is yet trodden under foot by the Papal Gentiles, <hi>Revelations</hi> 11.2. and the Woman (that is,—the Church of God,) is yet in the Wilderness, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6-14. The tyrannical power of the Papal Beast, according to the accompt of the best Ecclesiastick Historians, began about the year of our Lord 428. in the reign of the Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Second, when Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the III.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204666:76"/>a <hi>Roman,</hi> who at the instance of the Empress <hi>Eudoxias,</hi> made a holy day for St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church. And if the Historians say true, we may conjecture, that the ending time of the Beasts Forty Two Months, and of the Witnesses 1260. days, will be about 1688. for 1260. and 428. make 1688. or soon after. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though the 1260. days be almost expired, the testimony of the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses almost finished, and the Beasts tyrannical power almost come to its end, yet the full period thereof will not be certainly known to the Churches and Saints of God, until these Two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses be killed by the Beast. Read <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4-9. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. At the end it shall speak, and not lye. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When these <hi>[three days and an half]</hi> are come, (which are the last three years and an half of the 1260. years,) the Churches and Saints of God shall certainly know them to be the last days, by those most remarkable preceeding and concomitant signs thereof, which are noted in the holy Scripture of Truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Then will be such Tribulation as hath not been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the <hi>Jews, Dan.</hi> 12.1-4-7, 8, 9, 10. to the Gentiles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.21, 22-29, 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25, 26, 27. and to the Church of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then will the Gospel of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ be Preached, for a Witness unto all Nations, which is the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Testimony of the Two Witnesses, for which they shall be slain. Search those Scriptures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7-10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14-27, 28. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.7, 8, 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Then will happen a very great formality, lukewarmness, and worldliness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among Church Members, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1-5. holding up the form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—<hi>Et hos devita, vel ab his aversare,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. from such turn away. And the last and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Apostasy among Gospel Professors, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3. Except that Apostasy come first, which will also happen in those last days, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. Insomuch that our Saviour said, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the Earth? <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. For which Formality, and Apostasy, God will shortly and suddenly bring forth such a Dispensation of his Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204666:76"/>whereby those <hi>Laodicean</hi> Churches shall be broken in pieces, scattered and dispersed; and then will the Two Witnesses be killed, by whose mystical Resurrection will happen a very glorious Reformation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.1, 2-7-13-19-21, 22. even the times of the Restitution of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>viz.</hi> Churches, Ministry, Worship, and Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> Touching the means and manner of their reviving. The means of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Resurrection, and spiritual reviving of the Two Witnesses of Christ, is here expressed to be the spirit of life from God, which entred into them, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. The manner is also here declared. <hi>[And they stood upon their feet.]</hi> That is, they were raised, revived, and strengthened, imboldned, and encouraged by the spirit of life from God, which was poured upon them, and entred into them, to bear the same Testimony of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Antichrist, as formerly; and they were by the divine power and assistance of that spirit of life, enabled to stand boldly and publickly to that Testimony of Christ's Kingdom and Dominion; and this bears some Analogy unto that Dispensation Prophesied of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.5-14. <hi>O my people,—I will put my spirit in you, and you shall live.</hi> The Lord knows that his Servants, his Ministers, his Churches, and his Witnesses, are not able to say, do, or suffer much for Christ, without his holy spirit help and impower them, influence and assist them. And therefore, when God hath any eminent work to do, or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Witness to bear for Christ, his Truth, Worship, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; he doth not only raise up his Instruments to do that Work, and call up his Witnesses to bear their Testimony, but HE doth spirit them thereunto, as he did in former days. The spirit of God came upon <hi>Othoniel, Judg.</hi> 3.9, 10. upon <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 6.34. upon <hi>Jeptha, Judg.</hi> 11.29. upon <hi>Sampson, Judg.</hi> 14.19. and 15.14. upon <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13. so it shall do upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Witnesses of Christ in that day, when he shall call and raise them up to this Work and Testimony; And he that is feeble among them, at that day, shall be as <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Touching the present effect; <hi>[And great fear fell upon them which saw them.]</hi> They that saw these Two Witnesses of Christ arise from their Death, were them that dwell upon Earth, <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. who rejoiced over the dead Bodies of the slain Witnesses.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:204666:77"/>And now they are sorely amazed, and greatly afraid to see them stand upon their Feet. <hi>[And great fear fell upon them.]</hi> This Fear is not that holy and filial Fear of God, which the Lord puts into the hearts of his New-Covenant People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. but it is that terror and dread, wherewith God smites the Spirit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Adversaries of his People, whereby they are cut to the Heart, as they were, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.54.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And they heard a great voice from heaven, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</p>
               <p>The two Prophetical Witnesses being now raised and spirited for the Work of the Lord, are called up into an high Place and Condition; which calling is, 1. By <hi>[a great Voice from Heaven,]</hi> which they heard. 2. By that which the voice said unto them, <hi>[Come up hither.]</hi> 3. By their ready and willing Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that heavenly Call; <hi>[And they ascended up in a cloud.]</hi> 4. By their spectators; <hi>[and their Enemies beheld them.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>[voice from Heaven]</hi> is the voice of the Lord, who spake from Heaven, to his Servants the Prophets, in divers manners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. And he spake to his Apostles in Visions, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.9. The Lord spake to his People of old by the voice of his Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. And here the Lord speaks to his raised Witnesses, by the voice of the remnant of the Womans Seed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. which kept the Commandments of God, and have the Testimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, all the time that these two Witnesses were slain, and lay dead, and dispirited: Who being gathered and congregated together, and having among them at this time an eminent spirit of Prophecy (which is the Testimony of Jesus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10.) do call those raised Witnesses, into whom the spirit of Life from God was entered; saying unto them, <hi>[Come up hither.]</hi> Come and join with Us in the Church of God; come and worship God with Us; come and help Us to carry on the Work of the Lord in his Churches of Saints, according to his holy Word.</p>
               <p>When the Witnesses of Christ are killed and dispirited, and lie slain under deadness of Spirit, there will be even then a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnant
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204666:77"/>of the Womans Seed, which will keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and have the Testimony of Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And they ascended up into Heaven in a cloud:]</hi> By Heaven in this Verse, we may understand the holy, spiritual, and glorious state of the Church of God here on Earth in the latter Days, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.5. and 60.1-3-7-13-19, 20, 21. and 62.3, 4.65.1-12. which shall be in the time of Christ's Kingdom on Earth, when the Church of God shall be again like a Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of Twelve Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. even when the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall come down from God, out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, prepared as a Bride, adorned for her Husband, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>This Cloud is a Cloud of Testimony; and therefore were those former Believers (and Martyrs of Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Chapter) called a Cloud of Witnesses, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. This Cloud may also bear some Allusion to Christ's Transfiguration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.2, 3. or rather to his Ascension, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. For the spirit of Life from God entring into them, did not only transform them more and more into the Image of Christ, but did also raise them into an higher and more heavenly frame of spirit, than they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto before they were killed; in which respect they are said to stand upon their Feet, as is prophesied the People of the Jews shall do, at the time of their mystical Resurrection, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.3, 4, 5-9, 10, 11-14. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.2, 3-8, 9-11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And their Enemies beheld them.]</hi> The Witnesses Enemies are the Roman Anti-Christian Monarchy; the Beast that killed them, Mystical-Babylon; the great Whore and her Daughters, those Harlots, which are false, Churches; and the false Prophet, those Priests, Jesuits, false Teachers, Seducers, and all those Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that rejoiced at the Death of the Witnesses, and made merry, and sent Gifts one to another, <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. of this Chapter. Those Enemies shall behold with Amazement, Fear, and Horrour, these two prophetical Witnesses, when they shall ascend up to Heaven; that is, when they shall be honoured, exalted, and dignified in the glorious state of the Church of God on Earth.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Verse</hi> contains the concomitant Effects of the Witnesses Ascension. [<hi>And the same hour</hi> (that is, at the same time) <hi>there was a great earthquake,] viz.</hi> great commotions, overturnings, and terrible shakings of Nations, in the Kingdom of the Beast, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.6, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19. and 16.18. <hi>[And the tenth part of the city fell:]</hi> This City is that City <hi>Verse</hi> 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.19.

This third <hi>WO</hi> Trumpet must be sounded by the seventh Angel. The fifth Angel sounded, and one <hi>WO</hi> pass'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1-12. The sixth Angel sounded, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Wo</hi> pass'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.13. and 11.14. And when the seventh Angel begins to sound <hi>there shall be time no longer</hi> (as Christ hath sworn, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7.) unto the Roman Anti-christian Beast, for then the forty two months of his reigning Power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1-5. will be expired; then the thousand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score prophetical Days of Christs sackcloth Witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. will be fully ended, and then the Kingdoms of this World will successively, one after another, become the Kingdom of Christ, as here followeth in the 15. <hi>Verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> and then this third <hi>WO</hi> follows immediately, which containeth the third prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Vision, to wit, the seven Vials of the Wrath of God, which are the seven last Plagues, that are to be poured forth upon the Roman Anti-Christian Kingdom, Mystical Babylon, the Beast, the Whore, and the false Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10, 11. and 15.1-7.16.1-10. and the 18. Chapter of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Vers. 2-8-21.</p>
               <p>Now, although I have a very honourable esteem for those godly and learned Expositors of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who have declared their judgments, and some Reasons thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> That several of those Seven Vials have been poured out upon mystical
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:204666:79"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> and upon the Kingdom of the Beast; yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that they have said, I do humbly confess, that I am not of their minds, but do rather think, that none of those Seven Vials are yet poured out. And the Scripture grounds, which I humbly submit to the judgment of the judicious Reader, for my opinion in this matter, are, <hi>First,</hi> Because the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in Heaven, is not yet opened; out of which Temple the Seven Angels must come, who are to pour out those Seven Vials of the wrath of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6, 7. The opening of the Temple, is the restoring the Church of God on Earth unto its Apostolical Constitutions, and Primitive purity of Worship, and spiritual Gifts, and unto Christ's Ecclesiastical Government, which is not yet done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the second <hi>Wo</hi> is not yet past; and therefore the third <hi>Wo,</hi> (which is the Seven Vials of the wrath of God, as hath been fully proved) is not yet come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14. That the second <hi>Wo</hi> is not yet past, is evident; for Christ's Prophetical Witnesses are not ascended, nor the Seven Thousand Men of Name are not yet slain by the Earthquake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because the Seventh Angel hath not yet begun to sound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. For then, and not till then, those Vials of Gods Wrath and last Plagues are to be poured forth one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is revealed in the whole 16th. <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Prophecy. As the Seventh Seal ushered in the Seven Trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.1-6. so the Seventh Angel sounding, ushers in the Seven Vials, and brings in the Dispensation of the Kingdom of Christ, (which is not yet come) and the opening of the Temple of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (which is not yet done,) <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15-19. And out of the Temple shall come the Seven Angels, having those Seven last Plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6, 7. And after all these things, (then, and not till then) the Seven Angels are commanded by a great Voice from Heaven, saying to them, Go your ways, and pour out the Vials of the wrath of God upon the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because these last Plagues come upon mystical <hi>Babylon</hi> in one day, death, and mourning and famine; and she shall be utterly burnt with fire: For strong is the LORD that judgeth her. Compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1-16. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2-5-8-21. And a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great milstone, and cast it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204666:79"/>into the Sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great City <hi>Babylon</hi> be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And shall not be found thenceforth, after that, at all. A great Milstone cast into the Sea, doth not, cannot some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sink and sometimes swim; but always sinks even to the bottom, and never swims, no, never riseth again at all: So, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever mystical <hi>Babylon</hi> is once cast down and fallen, by the pouring out those Vials of Gods last Plagues upon her, she shall never, no, never rise more, but be made utterly desolate for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8-10-21.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The Kingdoms of this World are become <hi>the Kingdom</hi> of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever.</p>

For in them is filled up the Wrath of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.1. to be poured out without mixture (of any mercy) into the Cup of his Indignation; which Wine of the Wrath of God, mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and every one that <hi>(then)</hi> shall Worship the Beast, and his Image, and receive his Mark in his forehead, or in his hand, shall drink, and shall be tormented for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10, 11. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10-19. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2-8-21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As it was dangerous to Worship the Beast or his Image when HE was rising; so it will be damnable to Worship him or his Image, when HE is falling,</hi> Rev. 18.2-8, 9, 10-17, 18, 19. and 19.19, 20, 21. <hi>and</hi> Rev. 14.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>[And there were great Voices in Heaven, saying.]</hi> This publick Declaration of the glad Tydings, our Lord Jesus Christ revealed to his servant <hi>John,</hi> by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation for the comfort of his Churches, Ministers and Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1. and 21.9. By <hi>[Voices from Heaven]</hi> is meant his Ministring Spirits sent forth by Christ to Minister for them, who shall be Heirs of Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. so that the Doctrine of Christ's Kingdom hath Heavens Authority for it, touching which, here are two principal things asserted by these <hi>[Voices from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;] viz.</hi> Two Heavenly Truths. <hi>First,</hi> That the Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdom of Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That HE shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The Kingdoms of this World are become</hi> the Kingdom <hi>of our Lord, and of his Christ.</hi>] <hi>Are,</hi> that is, <hi>shall be,</hi> when the Seventh Angel soundeth; as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8. and 18.2 <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, that is, shall fall when God judgeth her, <hi>Vers.</hi> 8.21. By the Kingdoms of this World, we may understand, <hi>First,</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>David, Luk.</hi> 1.30-33. to wit, <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Israel, Mich.</hi> 4.18. And thou O Tower of the Flock, the strong-hold of the Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> unto thee shall it come, EVEN THE FIRST DOMINION. The Kingdom shall come to the Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem, Vers.</hi> 7. and the LORD shall reign over them in Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> from henceforth even for ever. Read <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Kingdoms of the <hi>Roman Caesars,</hi> which is the <hi>fourth Monarchy,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:204666:80"/>Dan.</hi> 2.40-44. And in the days of these Kings shall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>the Fifth Monarchy; viz.</hi> The Kingdom of Christ. <hi>Lastly,</hi> All the Kingdoms on the Earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. And there was given unto him Dominion and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations and Languages, should serve him: His Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom, that which shall not be destroyed, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. And the LORD shall be King over all the Earth: In that Day (<hi>viz.</hi> One day known to JEHOVAH, <hi>Vers.</hi> 7.) shall there be one Lord, and his Name <hi>One, Psal.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. These Prophecies have not yet been fulfilled, but they shall be fulfilled to a tittle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>
               <p>[<hi>The Kingdoms of this World</hi> shall <hi>become</hi> the Kingdom <hi>of Christ.</hi>] <hi>First,</hi> By Preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom in all the World, for a Witness to all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14-30. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7-14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By pouring out the spirit upon all flesh, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. By which dispensation of grace, the Earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.14. And in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (when that is opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5.) shall every one speak of his Glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 29.9, 10. The LORD sitteth King for ever. And then will the Saints bless him. They shall speak of the glory of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy power, to make known to the Sons of Men—the glorious Majesty of his Kingdom, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.1-10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By breaking <hi>[the Kingdoms of this World]</hi> to pieces, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34, 35-44. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands.—It shall break in pieces, and consume all these Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that after this manner; <hi>viz. First,</hi> God will make <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (that is, <hi>his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>) a burdensome stone for all People; all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Beast and the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies, will fall upon the chief corner stone, (which God hath laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6.) namely, <hi>Jesus Christ, Ephes.</hi> 2.20, 21. And afterwards that stone will fall upon them, by whom they shall be broken in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and grinded to powder. Read and compare those Scriptures for proof hereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.42, 43, 44. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13, 14-17.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:204666:81"/>and 19.19, 20, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.42, 43, 44. <hi>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. Therefore say I unto you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. Thirdly,</hi> The LORD Jesus Christ will then put down all Rule, and all Authority, and Power, (that are enemies to his Kingdom and Kingly Power) for he must reign till he have put all enemies under his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.12. Therefore King <hi>David</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying of those Kings of the Earth, and Rulers, that take counsel together against the LORD, and his Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.2, 3. doth thus exhort them, <hi>Vers.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings, be instructed, ye Judges of the Earth: —Kiss the SON, least HE be angry, and ye perish,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And the four and twenty Elders which sate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped God,</p>

               <p>These Two Verses contain a Doxology and Thanksgiving to God, (for the glad Tydings of the Kingdom of Christ declared from Heaven) by <hi>[the Four and Twenty Elders which sate before God on their seats;]</hi> They <hi>Worshipped God</hi> with Thanksgiving, <hi>&amp;c. Vers.</hi> 16.

In their Thanksgiving, we have, <hi>First,</hi> The object of Praises, [<hi>O LORD,</hi> the <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Almighty,</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:204666:81"/>
                  <hi>which art, and wast, and art to come.] Secondly,</hi> The matter of their Thanksgiving; that for which they give thanks to God: <hi>[Because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.]</hi> By the [<hi>LORD,</hi> the <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Almighty,</hi>] here we are to understand the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for he is called <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> our Righteousness, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. The true God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. which is, and which was, and which is to come. The Almighty, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5-8. This great power, is all power in Heaven, and on Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. By Christ his taking this <hi>[great power]</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, we are to understand the execution of Christ's Kingly Power on Earth; therefore it followeth, <hi>[And hast reigned.]</hi> Though the LORD Jesus Christ had this great power given him of his Father before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. yet he hath suffered other Lords to have Dominion over his people. As God suffered the Kings of the Nations to have Dominion over his people <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.36, 37. So the Lord Jesus Christ hath suffered the Princes of the Gentiles to exercise Dominion over his Saints, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25. The Saints at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3-7. also the Saints scattered throughout <hi>Pontus, Galatia,</hi> and other Gentile Countries, were exhorted to submit themselves to their Kingly Government, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14-17. For so is the will of God, <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. But the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. will in his time shew himself to be the only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15. By taking unto himself his great Power, and reigning on Earth. And Christ will then put down all Rule, and all Authority, and Power, that are his Enemies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25. for HE must reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</p>

               <p>The effect of Christ's Execution of his Kingly Power and Government, as King of Nations, whom they should fear,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204666:82"/>
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7-10. is as here followeth, <hi>[The Nations were angry.]</hi> Or as <hi>David</hi> Prophetically expounds it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. The Heathen rage, the Kings of the Earth (who from the rise to the ruine of the Beast, give their Kingdom, their Power and Strength unto him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13-17.) set themselves, and the Rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. This opposition of the Kings, Rulers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, will provoke the Lord to be angry against them, as here followeth. <hi>[And thy wrath is come.]</hi> So <hi>David</hi> Prophesied, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.5. Then shall HE speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his hot displeasure. Such a dispensation was very terrible to the Kings, and Princes, and Captains, and People of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Empire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. And the Kings of the Earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and every bond-man, and every free-man, hid themselves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains. And said to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand? And so will this day of Christ's great indignation be when his wrath shall come upon the Kings, the Rulers, the Counsellors, the Captains, and the People of the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Empire, and Antichristian Kingdoms of this World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the Whore sitteth, are Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.11-21. The effect of Christ's wrath will be their utter destruction, as here followeth; <hi>[And</hi> to <hi>destroy them that destroy the Earth,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>and the time of the dead that they should be judged.]</hi> This is another effect that will follow upon Curist's coming to set up his Kingdom on Earth, when He shall take unto himself his Kingly Power, and hath reigned, till God hath put all his enemies under his feet, then the time will come, when the dead shall be judged, and all the Saints shall be rewarded by the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>The dead that are to be judged incontradistinction to the Saints, that are to be rewarded, are all persons without Christ, (when

For Christ shall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And that thou shouldest give the reward,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12.

               <p>The time of Christ's Two Witnesses, prophesying in sackcloth, and the time of the <hi>Womans</hi> being in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> is the same, [<hi>a thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore</hi> Prophetical <hi>days;</hi>] each day for a year.

               <p>Now to find out the <hi>end</hi> of these <hi>[a thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days,]</hi> let us consider, <hi>first,</hi> That the Lord gave his holy Prophets to number years by days, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>each day for a year.</hi> And times by years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.16-25-32. <hi>Seven times</hi> for seven years. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Three days and an half</hi> are three years and an half; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. <hi>The Time, and Times, and half a Time,</hi> are Three years and an half. And upon these Scripture grounds, we may <hi>certainly</hi> conclude, <hi>that as the Three days and an half</hi> are the ending time of the Witnesses [<hi>thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days,</hi>] so the Time, Times, and an half, are the last three years and an half of her <hi>[thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score days.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Three days and an half (which are the <hi>ending</hi> time of the Witnesses <hi>a thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days,</hi>) are <hi>expresly</hi> said to be between their being killed and their rising again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7-11. <hi>See the Exposition thereof.</hi> And therefore, when we see the Witnesses of Christ, his Churches, and his Ministers killed by the Beast, we may <hi>certainly</hi> conclude, that the ending time of their <hi>[thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days,]</hi> are come and begun.</p>
               <p>Consider, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ told his servant <hi>John,</hi> That <hi>after Three days and an half the spirit of life from God entred into the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> and they prophesied <hi>again, Rev.</hi> 11.11. <hi>before Kings,</hi> and bare their Testimony <hi>again</hi> for Jesus Christ, as King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. King of <hi>Sion, Psal.</hi> 149.1, 2. and King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. King of Kings, the only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. King of all the Earth, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. And therefore, when we see the <hi>mystical</hi> Resurrection of the Witnesses, and hear them <hi>prophesy</hi> again, and bear their Testimony <hi>publickly</hi> for Christ, his Magistracy, Ministry, Churches, Ordinances, Worship, Discipline and Government, against Antichrist, his Magistracy, Ministry, Churches, Ordinances, Worship, Discipline and Government; we may <hi>certainly</hi> conclude, that the end of the <hi>[thousand two hundred</hi> and <hi>threescore days]</hi> is fully come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11, 12-15.</p>

               <p>By <hi>Heaven</hi> here, we may understand the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the <hi>Dragon's</hi> Kingdom, where <hi>John</hi> saw the great <hi>red</hi> Dragon, <hi>Vers.</hi> 3.

The Christian Emperors (especially <hi>Constantine the Great</hi>) were his Lieutenant-generals; the Christian Kings and Governours were his Angels; <hi>that is,</hi> his Commissioned Officers; the Laws and Decrees of the Christian Emperors, against Idols and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Worship was their Commission, <hi>[The Dragon and his Angels;]</hi> that is, the Devil. The Heathen Emperors by their Laws and Decrees against the Christians, gave Commission to their Commanders and Officers, the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Kings, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Armies, to kill and destroy the Christians, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23-25-27, 28.</p>

               <p>Here followeth the issue of this set Battle. <hi>[And prevailed not;]</hi> that is, The Heathen Emperors were overcome, and their Thrones cast down; <hi>[Neither was their place found any more in Heaven;]</hi> that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Empire, called <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Dragon's Heaven.

               <p>
                  <hi>[The great Dragon]</hi> is here <hi>[called the Devil;]</hi> that is, the grand Accuser, <hi>[that old Serpent]</hi> who beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> by his subtilties, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>[and Satan;]</hi> that is, the Christians grand Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,

               <p n="10">10. And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser of our Brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</p>
               <p>The <hi>voice</hi> that the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Servant</hi> of Jesus Christ, heard in <hi>Heaven,</hi> was the joyful Praises and Thanksgiving of the faithful Ministers and People in the Churches of Saints. The matter of their Praises was, <hi>First, [Salvation,]</hi> which God wrought for them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> which God raised up for their defence against the tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperors, by <hi>Constantine the Great:</hi> And <hi>Thirdly, [The Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ;]</hi> that is, the establishment of both <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government, according to the Laws of God, and the Constitutions of our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Fourthly, [The Accuser of our Brethren is cast down,]</hi> that is, the old Serpent called the Devil and Satan, the grand <hi>Accuser</hi> of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p>
               <p>Here is recorded the Saints victory over the Devil and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and all their enemies; <hi>First, [By the blood of the Lamb;]</hi> that is, by the Power and Efficacy of the sufferings and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the <hi>virtual</hi> application of his precious blood. <hi>Secondly, [By the word of their testimony,]</hi> which did convince many Adversaries, convert some Sinners, and did strengthen the Faith and Courage of very many weak Christians, as the best Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians do testify. <hi>[And they loved not their lives unto the death.]</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:204666:87"/>They esteemed nothing <hi>too</hi> much, <hi>too</hi> great, or <hi>too</hi> good to lose for Christ; they took the spoiling of their goods joyfully; they being tortured, would not accept deliverance, hoping for a better Resurrection, as those Primitive Believers did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36, 37. They were willing to lose all, forsake all, and deny all Estates, Liberties, Relations, and Lives, for Christ and the Gospel, the <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and for the true Worship of God, and Ordinances of Jesus Christ.</p>

               <p>By <hi>sea</hi> here, we may understand some very great confluence of People, and Nations. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. Learned <hi>Meade</hi> in his <hi>Comment upon Rev.</hi> 8. saith, that <hi>Alaricus,</hi> with an huge Host of <hi>Goths,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians, Alans, Huns,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>By the <hi>Beast</hi> here, we may understand the <hi>Beast of the Eighth head,</hi> Rev. 17.11. See the <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof, the Popedom of <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> with his Ten <hi>Crowned Horns;</hi> Horns, which Mr. <hi>Meade</hi> saith, are, <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Britans; Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Saxons; Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Franks; Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Burgundians; Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Wisigothes; Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Swedes; Seventhly,</hi> The <hi>Vandals; Eighthly,</hi> The <hi>Alemans; Ninthly,</hi> The <hi>Ostrogoths; Tenthly,</hi> The <hi>Grecians.</hi> These were Ten <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces, who received power as Kings one hour with the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12. See the <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof. The Seven Heads had the Crowns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. <hi>[And upon his heads the name of blasphemy;]</hi> that is, They were all Seven Idolaters, see <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.10. who Worshipped Idols of Stone, Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Historians differ about the exact year of the <hi>Beasts</hi> rising, but most <hi>probable</hi> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 410. and 428. which will appear before 1688. be fully ended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the Beast which I saw was like unto a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, and his feet were as <hi>the feet</hi> of a Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion; and the Dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:204666:89"/>
               <p>Here we have the description of the <hi>Beast</hi> which rose out of the sea. <hi>First, [Like unto a Leopard.]</hi> The <hi>Leopard</hi> is a swift Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.8. and a Beast of Prey, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.6. and so is this Beast of the Seventh and Eighth Head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10.11. See the <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Secondly, [His feet were as</hi> the feet <hi>of a Bear.]</hi> Rending and tearing in pieces all that he takes for his Prey, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.19-23. <hi>Thirdly, [And his mouth as the mouth of a Lion.]</hi> Which is the strongest and most devouring Beast of Prey. So are the Popes in the exercise of their Antichristian Power and Dominion over all in their Kingdom. <hi>[And the Dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great Authority.]</hi> By the <hi>Dragon,</hi> we are to understand <hi>that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan,</hi> Chap. 12.9. and Chap. 20.2. See the <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof. The <hi>Throne</hi> of the Beast, is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this World, especially the <hi>Ten Crowned Kingdoms</hi> before mentioned, whereof <hi>Great Britain</hi> is <hi>first,</hi> and shall be the <hi>last.</hi> The power of the Beast, is his <hi>Poli-ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> in all <hi>Causes,</hi> and over all <hi>Persons, Civil, Military, Maritine,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> and therefore, <hi>here</hi> called <hi>[great Authority,]</hi> Vers. 4th. of this <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</hi> Who is like unto the Beast, who is able to make War with him? The <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan <hi>[power, and great authority,]</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal <hi>[power, and seat, and great authority,]</hi> is of the Devil, the <hi>Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And I saw one of his heads, as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondred after the Beast.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Head, the Pope, who is the Eighth Head, and is of the Seven, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10, 11. The Beast that <hi>John</hi> saw rise out of the sea, had Seven Heads and Ten Horns <hi>as well as the Dragon,</hi> only the <hi>principal</hi> distinction between them is this, The Dragons Heads were Crowned, and the Beasts Horns were Crowned, (as hath been shewed in the <hi>Exposition</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. and this 13th. <hi>Chapter, Vers.</hi> 1.) By <hi>[one of</hi> the Beasts <hi>Heads,]</hi> we are to understand the last head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Dragon; <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Seventh</hi> head, and the First head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Beast, was wounded (as it were) unto death, <hi>that is,</hi> had a deadly wound given him by the great <hi>Barbarian</hi> Armies, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

[And his deadly wound was healed;]</hi> that is, By the Beast that came up out of the Earth, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11, 12. See the <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof. <hi>[And all the world wondred after the Beast.]</hi> By <hi>[the world]</hi> here, we are to understand all the <hi>then</hi> Inhabiters of the Earth, whose Names are not written in the <hi>Lamb's</hi> book of Life, <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. By [wondring <hi>after the Beast,]</hi> we may understand their <hi>admiring</hi> of him, as <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. <hi>And they Worshipped the Beast, saying, Who</hi> is <hi>like unto the Beast? who is able to make War with him?</hi> And their <hi>adoring</hi> of him above all that is called God, or that is Worshipped, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And they worshipped the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast: and they worshipped the Beast, saying, Who <hi>is</hi> like unto the Beast? who is able to make war with him?</p>
               <p>This Worship of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and of the <hi>Beast,</hi> was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and superstitious Worship, which is accounted a Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Devil, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21, 22. As the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Idols, and Images, is called Worshipping the Devil. (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.20. See the <hi>Exposition.</hi>) So the Papists Worshipping Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Crosses, Crucifixes, Saints deceased, the Image of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Worshipping the Devil. Also the great <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that the Papists give unto the Pope himself, and to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>(not a divine, but)</hi> a Devilish Worship.

[<hi>Who is able to make War with</hi> the Beast?] All Kings and Emperors submitted themselves, their Power, Strength, and Kingdoms, unto the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13, 17. See the <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof.

That which Christ would have them to <hi>hear,</hi> is expressed <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. <hi>[He that leadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword, must be killed with the sword.]</hi> These words contain a commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous judgments of God relating to Mystery <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as was threatned <hi>Prophetically, Psal.</hi> 137.7, 8, 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.1, 2-5. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6, 7, 8. <hi>[Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints;] that is,</hi> the exercise and trial of the Patience and Faith of the Saints, (who are sanctified Believers) under the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Tribulations, which the Beast, the great Whore, and the false Prophet, will inflict upon them; during the time of Forty <hi>and</hi> Two Months, that the Gentiles, <hi>that is,</hi> the idolatrous Papists shall tread the <hi>holy</hi> City, <hi>that is,</hi> the Church of God, under foot; during which time of Forty <hi>and</hi> Two Months, the Beast will exercise his coercive power, in Persecuting the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. and 13.5.</p>

[And he spake as a Dragon.]</hi> His speech bewrayeth him to be a <hi>devouring</hi> Beast, and not a Lamb. For though he pretends to be for Christ, the Lamb of God, (as his Vicar general,) both in respect of his <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Power, which is his <hi>[Two horns;]</hi> yet he exerciseth both for the Dragon, that old Serpent called the Devil and Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him, and causeth the earth, and them which dwell therein, to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beast</hi> had his <hi>power</hi> given him by the <hi>Dragon, Vers.</hi> 2. here he exerciseth his <hi>power; And he spake as a Dragon.

               <p>

So Antichrist and his <hi>false</hi> Teachers, the Pope and his <hi>false</hi> Prophets, do Wonders to deceive the People, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. and 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, Signs, and lying Wonders.</hi>

               <p>The Man of Sin, the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 7. and 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>And with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.

                  <hi>See the Exposition;</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Dominion, and <hi>especially, the Ʋniversal</hi> Head of the Catholick Church, <hi>the Bishop of Rome,</hi> so declared by the Emperor <hi>Phocas,</hi> and so acknowledged <hi>to be,</hi> by the <hi>professed</hi> subjection of all the Papists. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The matter of the Edict or Law, that the Beast doth impose, and compel obedience unto. [<hi>He causeth all</hi> men <hi>to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</hi>] And also, that they have <hi>[the name of the Beast, or the number of his name.] Thirdly,</hi> The Persons on whom he imposeth this his <hi>Edict</hi> or <hi>Law. [He causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.] Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>penalty</hi> to be <hi>inflicted</hi> upon him that will not <hi>submit</hi> to that Law of the Beast. <hi>[And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name.]</hi> And in the <hi>last Verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> we are exhorted to count the number of the <hi>Beast.</hi> And <hi>First,</hi> We are told, that it is <hi>the number of a man,</hi> namely, of <hi>the man of sin,</hi> 2 Thess. 2.3. <hi>The Son of Perdition, who goeth into Perdition,</hi> Rev. 17.11. The <hi>Eighth</hi> King or kind of Government; that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Dominion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are there told, that his number is [<hi>six hundred threescore</hi> and <hi>six.</hi>] <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he, that would count this number of the Beast, must be indued with wisdom and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>[Here is Wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast.]</hi> The <hi>true Exposition</hi> of these Three <hi>Verses</hi> doth consist in the <hi>right Interpretation</hi> of those Three things expressed in the Seventeenth <hi>Verse,</hi> which are the Mark, the Name of the Beast, and the number of his Name. For these Three things have a mutual Relation to the Beast, and to his Image, and to their Worshippers; and also one to another. Compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15, 16, 17. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11. and <hi>seriously</hi> consider the <hi>Exposition</hi> of both those Scriptures, and the Lord give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>By <hi>[the name of the Beast,]</hi> we are to understand, that by which he is <hi>commonly</hi> known; <hi>that is,</hi> his soveraign Power and Supremacy in all matters, and over all Persons, both <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as Lord and Head of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church on Earth; and the <hi>only</hi> Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. <hi>For he opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:204666:93"/>God, or that is Worshipped,</hi> 2 Thess. 2.4. <hi>Shewing himself</hi> that he is God. And herein the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichrist, and his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecclesiastick Dominion</hi> is Antichristian. For God hath set our Lord Jesus Christ far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Mark</hi> received in the right Hand and in the Forehead, we are to understand the Profession of the Faith of a Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by and through which he doth acknowledge his Subjection, and Allegiance to the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Definition of the <hi>Mark</hi> received in the right Hand and in the Forehead agreeth, <hi>First, Omni,</hi> to every Subject in the Beast's Kingdom; for he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a Mark, <hi>Vers.</hi> 16, 17. Though all are not Cardinals, all are not Arch-bishops, all are not Lord Bishops, yet all are Catholicks, all agree in this, To profess the Universal Headship of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is <hi>Nota maxime communis. Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Mark</hi> agreeth <hi>Soli,</hi> only to such as are subjects of the Beast's Kingdom, and to none else. Here is <hi>Nota maxime propria. Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Mark</hi> agreeth <hi>semper,</hi> at all Times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.2. and 20.4. of the Beast's Dominion from the beginning to the end of his Kingdom. The Name of <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship is that which giveth Foundation to the Mark or Profession, <hi>à priori.</hi> And the Mark or Profession is that which declareth the Name, or <hi>universal</hi> Headship <hi>à posteriori;</hi> and therefore it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Mark of his Name,</hi> Rev. 14.11. <hi>And receive the Mark of his Name.</hi> The Punishments there threatned shew how great a Sin it is against Christ openly to profess <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship of the Pope. It was always <hi>dangerous</hi> to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Beast or his Image, or receive his Mark; but now it will be <hi>Damnable, Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11. It is the peculiar and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable preheminence of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be the only Head of the Church of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. Therefore what Man so ever doth ascribe the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship of the Church to any but our Lord Jesus Christ, doth (as much as in him lies) dethrone Christ, and put him from his Kingly and Soveraign Dignity, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:204666:93"/>
               <p>By <hi>[the Number of the Beast]</hi> we are to understand the Year <hi>Six hundred three score and six,</hi> Vers. 18. Some Expositors have thought this Number to be the <hi>finishing</hi> or ending time of the Beast's Kingdom; but they were mistaken; for it was foretold <hi>John</hi> to be the Beginning time of the Beast's <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship. Now the Wisdom given to understand this Time and <hi>Number of the Beast,</hi> is to make a just account of the Time from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Roman Kingdom unto the <hi>six hundred sixty sixth</hi> Year thereof; when the Emperor <hi>Phocas,</hi> by his Edict, declared the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Head of the Church; <hi>which was</hi> Boniface <hi>the Third.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sum of all is this, <hi>First,</hi> If you consider the <hi>Papacy</hi> as a State or Government, persecuting and afflicting the People of God under their Dominion, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, so it is called the Beast. Secondly,</hi> If you consider the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Form and Essence of that Kingdom and Dominion doth consist) <hi>that is, the Name of the Beast. Thirdly,</hi> If you consider, that <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship as a <hi>Representative</hi> of that <hi>soveraign</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty that was lost in <hi>Rome</hi> Imperial, and now repaired in <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, <hi>that is the Image of the Beast. Fourthly,</hi> If you consider the publick Profession of Subjection unto the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship of the Bishop of <hi>Rome, that is the Mark of the Beast. Fifthly,</hi> If you consider the <hi>time</hi> when this <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Headship began visibly and notoriously to appear, to be declared, owned and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, <hi>that is the Number of the Beast.</hi> All these are distinct <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptical</hi> Considerations, touching the Beast.</p>

                  <hi>[Having his Fathers Name written in their Foreheads.]</hi> This doth distinguish the Followers of the Lamb from the Worshippers and Followers of the Beast.

               <p>By the <hi>[sea of glass,]</hi> we are to understand the holy Ordinances of the Gospel, and pure Worship of God: See <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.6. being

The Ordinances of the Gospel give a more clear vision of Christ, than those under the Law. It is here said to be mingled with fire, with respect of those Tribulations, and Persecutions, which the Churches, Ministers, and Members of Christ, should suffer for worshipping God in his holy Ordinances.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And them that had gotten the victory over the Beast, and over his Image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name.</hi> See the <hi>Exposition</hi> of all these in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. and 12.11. And they stood <hi>[on the sea of glass;]</hi> that is, these Victors continued in the true and pure Worship of God, according to the Institutions of our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>[Having the harps of God.]</hi> Their hearts were kept in an Heavenly frame, being so tuned and prepared by the holy Spirit of God.

               <p n="1">1. AND I heard a great voice out of the Temple, saying to the seven angels, go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>great voice</hi> that <hi>John</hi> heard <hi>out of the Temple,</hi> was the voice of the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.6. <hi>A voice from the Temple, the voice of the Lord that rendreth recompence to his enemies.</hi> By <hi>earth</hi> here, we are to understand the whole. <hi>Roman</hi> Papal state, both Political, and Ecclesiastical; called Mystery <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the Beast, and <hi>upon</hi> them which worshipped his image.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> in this Verse, doth <hi>metonymically</hi> signify the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters of the <hi>Popish</hi> Earth, the earthly state of the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Kingdom; <hi>that is,</hi> those Inhabiters of the Earth against whom the third Wo is pronounced, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.13. <hi>especially</hi> those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at the killing of Christ's <hi>Two</hi> prophetical Witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. By the [<hi>noisome and grievous sore that fell upon the men which had the mark of the Beast, and</hi> upon <hi>them which worshipped his image,</hi>] we may understand (by some allusion which this plague-sore beareth to that upon the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 9.10, 11.) such a plague as causeth very great pain, and is so noisome and pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that it maketh those men that are lovers and friends to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> to stand a-far off for fear of the torment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.10-15-17. which are the proper effects of such noisome and grievous sores, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.11. and 77.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:204666:101"/>
               <p>By <hi>Sea</hi> here, we may understand the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the See of <hi>York,</hi> and all other <hi>Ecclesiastical, Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,</hi> and <hi>Diocesan</hi> Sees; <hi>especially,</hi> the Popes <hi>See,</hi> &amp;c. In which See of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> those Kings of the earth, who give their power, strength, and kingdom to the Beast, and all <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> Merchants, and Ship-Masters, and as many as Trade by Sea, and traffick for Estates, for Slaves, and for Souls of Men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.9, 10, 11-13-17-19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the Sea.]</hi> So that the effects of this <hi>vial</hi> is death, unto them that worship the Beast or his Image, or receive his mark, name, or the number of his name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8. not only tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral but eternal death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11. See the <hi>Exposition</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For they have shed the blood of saints and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so Lord God almighty, true and righteous <hi>are</hi> thy judgments.</p>
               <p>By these mystical <hi>[rivers and fountains of waters,]</hi> we may understand the Emperors, Kings, Princes and Nobles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Kingdom, which give their power and strength to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> as the Rivers and Fountains of Waters run into the sea, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.7. The great Monarchs and Kings of the Earth are called the heads of their Rivers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.3, 4. and 32.2-6. <hi>that is,</hi> of their <hi>mystical</hi> Waters. <hi>[And they became blood.]</hi> Which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204666:101"/>plague may bear some allusion unto that plague of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 7.20, 21. so God will give Mystical <hi>Babylon</hi> blood to drink, for she hath shed the blood of the Saints, and of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of <hi>Jesus, Rev.</hi> 16.6.17.6.18.24. and 19.2. <hi>[And the Angel of the Waters]</hi> and another Angel acknowledged and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God is just and righteous in judging thus. [<hi>And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so Lord God almighty, true and righteous</hi> are <hi>thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>sun</hi> here, we are to understand the Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are the great Lights in the <hi>Roman</hi> Papal Kingdom, who Rule the day of the Antichristian State, as the Sun in the Firmament doth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.15. rule and govern the natural day. The effect of this <hi>vial</hi> or plague is the scorching of the Men of the Beasts Kingdom with great heat, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. They that Worship the Beast or his Image, or receive his mark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are tormented with fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10, 11. see the Exposition. And they repented not to give glory to God. Impenitent Papists will be tormented for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the Beast; and his kingdom was full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And blasphemed the God of Heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:204666:102"/>
               <p>By [<hi>the seat,</hi> or throne <hi>of the Beast,</hi>] we are to understand the Place where the Beast hath his chief Residence, and where his highest Court is kept, and where his Holiness's Chair is set, in which the <hi>Pope</hi> sitteth as the Infallible Judge; <hi>that is,</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome;</hi> for there his Throne is placed, and his great Power, and Authority is <hi>principally</hi> exercised. The Effects of this <hi>Vial</hi> or Plague are Four, <hi>First, [His Kingdom was full of darkness:]</hi> That is, the Beast's Kingdom and Dominion, both <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> was greatly eclipsed and clouded. The Ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> will exceedingly darken the Grandure, Glory and Pomp of the Beast. <hi>Secondly, [And they gnawed their Tongues for pain:]</hi> That is, they that Worshipped the Beast, or his Image, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Mark; namely, his Kings, his Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and pained with grief, and sorrow, and sores, when they saw that great City burned and utterly destroyed by the righteous Judgments of God, <hi>Rev,</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10-19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And repented not of their deeds.]</hi> That is of their Idolatries, Murders, Massacrees, Persecutions, and Worshipping the Beast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. And the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great River Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared.</p>
               <p>The object of God's Wrath and Plague poured out of this <hi>sixth vial</hi> is <hi>the great River Euphrates.</hi> There was a River which ran through <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> unto old <hi>Babylon,</hi> that by way of <hi>eminency</hi> is called the great River, the River <hi>Euphrates, Gen.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>Josh.</hi> 1.4. unto which this River may bear some Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The principal Benefits of a great River are Three, <hi>First,</hi> Revenue, <hi>Isa.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Strength, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Riches, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.12-18-29-33. so of <hi>mystical Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18.10, 11, 12-17. <hi>[And the water thereof was dried up.]</hi> By Waters we may understand Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. By the <hi>drying up of the Waters,</hi> we may understand the wasting and destroying of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Dominion, Kingdom and Power, as the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Dominion was inlarged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sixth Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.14. so it shall be wasted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed

               <p>
                  <hi>[That the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared.]</hi> By <hi>the Kings of the East,</hi> we are to understand <hi>the Jews,</hi> whom God hath promised to bring from the East, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.5. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Kings (as all the Lord's Redeemed ones are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10.) for they shall have the first Dominion, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.8. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.1, 2, 3. And <hi>Kings of the East,</hi> because God hath promised to save them from the East Country, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.7-13. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.44, 45.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And I saw three unclean spirits like Frogs <hi>come</hi> out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>John</hi> saw and heard in this Vision, related <hi>Vers.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. was preparatory unto the Supper of the great God <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.18.17.18.19.20. and Interval between the sixth and seventh Vial; in which vision <hi>John</hi> [<hi>saw three unclean spirits like Frogs</hi> (croaking Frogs) come <hi>out of the mouth of the Dragon;</hi>] that old Serpent called <hi>the Devil;</hi> [<hi>and out of the mouth of the Beast,</hi> (the Pope) <hi>and out of the mouth of the false Prophet;</hi>] the Papal Priests, Cardinals, Lord Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The unclean Spirits are here said to be <hi>[the spirits of Devils, working miracles,]</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.13, 14. Like that lying Spirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s false Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21, 22.

               <p>The Sixth Head, the <hi>Roman Caesars</hi> had <hi>[ten horns;]</hi> that is, Provinces, and Provincial Legates, Governours under them: But the Seventh Head, and Eighth King of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom hath ten Crowned Horns; <hi>that is,</hi> Ten Kings and Kingdoms under his Dominion. <hi>[Which have received no Kingdom as yet;]</hi> that is, In <hi>John</hi>'s time, before the Beast of the Seventh Head, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Eighth King did rise, and came to be King of Kings, then [<hi>they receive power as Kings one hour</hi> (at the same time) <hi>with the Beast</hi>] of the Seventh Head, the Eighth King.

               <p>This is the Angel that poured forth the <hi>fifth</hi> Vial upon the Seat or Throne of the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10. The School-men tell us, there are <hi>three</hi> degrees of the holy Angels. The <hi>first</hi> Hierarchy are Seraphims, Cherubims, and Thrones; the <hi>second</hi> hath Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Virtues, and Powers; the <hi>third</hi> hath Principalities, Arch-Angels and Angels.

And I will render unto Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion, in your sight, saith the Lord.</hi> Psal. 149.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Praise ye the Lord, sing unto the Lord a new Song,</hi> and <hi>his praise in the congregation of Saints.

And the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb</hi> is <hi>the Light thereof.

For behold, the darkness shall cover the Earth, and gross darkness the People: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his Glory shall be seen upon thee.

All the Flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the Rams of Nebaioth shall minister un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine Altar, and I will glorifie the House of my Glory. The Glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the Fir-tree, the Pine-tree, and the Box together, to beautifie the place of my Sanctuary, and I will make the place of my Feet glorious. The sons also of them that afflicted thee, shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee, shall bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves down at the soles of thy Feet; and they shall call thee, The City of the LORD, the Zion of the holy One of Israel. Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no Man went through</hi> thee, <hi>I will make thee an Eternal Excellency, a joy of many Generations. Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy Moon withdraw it self: for the LORD shall be, thine everlasting Light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.

               <p>By the Commandments of God, we are to unsterstand the moral Law which Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfil.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This voice hath Heaven's Authority, <hi>It was from Heaven,</hi> to wit, the voice of Christ in the Ministry of the Gospel <hi>ordinarily,</hi> and by the <hi>powerful</hi> Efficacy of the holy Spirit <hi>also,</hi> 1 Thes. 1.5. <hi>For our Gospel came not unto you in the Word only, but also in Power, and in the holy Spirit, and in much assurance.</hi> So had the voice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God by whom Christ <hi>then</hi> spake unto his Servant <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 14.6-13. <hi>with a loud voice,</hi> vers. 7. which St. <hi>John</hi> heard from Heaven, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To come out of HER, is to Separate themselves from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is <hi>now</hi> become a <hi>false</hi> Church, called <hi>the great Whore, and Mother of Harlots,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14-18. vers. 17. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord.</hi> The Lord Jesus Christ would have his People to be <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> under the Gospel <hi>from the unbelieving Jews, and their false worship (which Christ called vain worship,</hi> Matth. 15.8, 9.) And St. <hi>Paul</hi> did separate the Disciples from the Jewish <hi>Synogogue</hi> of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.8, 9. <hi>And also from idolatrous Gentiles,</hi> that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Images, (<hi>as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth</hi>) <hi>and from their Idol-Temples, Churches, and Chapels;</hi> for the <hi>Gentile</hi> Papists, and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Pope, Cardinals, Jesuits, and all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Priests do tread under foot the holy City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:204666:126"/>viz.</hi> the Church and People of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17. <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath said,</hi> Levit. 20.24-26. and 26.12. <hi>I will dwell among them, and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be my People: wherefore Come out from among them, and be ye separated saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean Thing,</hi> &amp;c. The Papists Images, Crosses, Crucifixes; their Consecrated Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, holy Waters, and Saints Pictures, the Image of the <hi>Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and of our Saviour upon the Cross, <hi>unto which Images the Popish Priests and People fall down and Worship;</hi> yea their <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and Prayers to Saints deceased, all their holy Bells, Beads, Prayer Books, and Candles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all as an unclean thing, and ought to be <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from, and not <hi>touched</hi> by the People of God, whom Christ calls upon <hi>with a loud voice</hi> to come out from among them.</p>
               <p>These two particulars explained the <hi>Argument</hi> which Christ <hi>urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> to <hi>inforce</hi> this his <hi>Call</hi> unto his People followeth, <hi>That ye be not Partakers of HER Sins, and that ye receive not of HER Plagues.</hi> As if Christ had said, I do by the voice of my faithful Ministers Call and Command you <hi>my People</hi> to come out of Mystical <hi>Babylon (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Rome)</hi> and to <hi>separate</hi> your selves from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is fallen, is fallen from her Apostolical Purity in Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline <hi>or Ecclesiastical Government,</hi> and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Harlot, a <hi>false</hi> Church, the great Whore, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth, the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of Satan, the <hi>Habitation</hi> of Devils, the <hi>Hold</hi> of every <hi>foul</hi> Spirit, and a <hi>Cage</hi> of every <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>hateful</hi> Bird. But if you <hi>my People</hi> (as if Christ had said) will not obey my voice, nor hear my <hi>Call;</hi> if you will not come out from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and separate your selves from the Papists, and leave going to and worshipping in their Popish Temples, Churches, Chapels, and private Cloysters, Nunneries, Priories, Religious Houses, Meeting places, and holy Roods of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular</hi> Confession, <hi>&amp;c. then</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> place you will be <hi>Partakers</hi> of their Sins, <hi>that is,</hi> you will become guilty of their Will-worship, and spiritual Fornication, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2. of their Idolatries, Adulteries, Thefts, Murders, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 9.20, 21. And of their Impenitency added unto their Iniquities. And in the next place you shall <hi>receive</hi> of her Plagues, <hi>Death and Mourning and Famine,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 18.8. <hi>And these shall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mixture into the Cup of his Indignation,</hi> Rev. 14.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
